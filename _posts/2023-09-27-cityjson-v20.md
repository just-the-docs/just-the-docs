We've been working hard, in collaboration with [Geonovum](https://www.geonovum.nl/), on improving CityJSON and we're happy today to release version 2.0 🎉🍾🚀


## The full specifications

[CityJSON v2.0.0 specifications]({{ site.baseurl }}/specs/2.0.0/)


## Software 

Perhaps more importantly, we have updated the eco-systems:

  - [cjio](https://github.com/cityjson/cjio) has been updated to v0.9 and offers an upgrade operator to automatically upgrade your existing files to v2.0
  - [cjval (the official validator)](https://validator.cityjson.org/)
  - you can [upgrade your files automatically and pain-free]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/upgrade20/)
  - [the online view ninja](https://ninja.cityjson.org/) supports v2.0 already 

Other software like [azul](https://github.com/tudelft3d/azul), [FME](https://github.com/safesoftware/fme-CityJSON/), and [citygml4j](https://github.com/citygml4j/citygml-tools) will be updated soon.

## Developer?

If you are a developer, you can see [on this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/upgrade20/) what you need to do to update your code to be ready for v1.1 files.
Most changes are small, and we expect this upgrade to take a maximum of a few minutes.
