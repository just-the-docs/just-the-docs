This plugin uses coordination referencing system (CRS) and metadata to reproject and translate the data, ensuring seamless implementation within Revit.

The plugin can be downloaded free of charge at the [Autodesk App Store](https://apps.autodesk.com/RVT/en/Detail/Index?id=7787623024858844510&appLang=en&os=Win64), and its [source code](https://github.com/tudelft3d/cityjsonToRevit) is openly available for users who wish to access it.
