**Purpose**

Help everyone at Countable understand the different types of meetings we
hold, and how to get the most benefit out of the fewest meetings.

**Scope**

Defines expectations for all meetings, then goes into details for
specific types of meetings.

## All Meetings

### Date and Time of Meetings

  - Meetings should, where possible, be booked during business hours,
    because we want to encourage work-life balance on the team (and any
    formal expectation to regularly meet outside business hours is
    damaging to that)
  - Our calendar is the source of truth regarding meeting times,
    attendees and cancellation status. All updates to meeting times go
    directly in the calendar.
  - Meetings start on time and stop on time. If someone is late, start
    without them. Anyone who is late or not attending should notify the
    team in advance.
  - When meeting with external stakeholders, book 50 minute meetings
    generally (or 25) so there are 5 minute gaps for our brains to
    context switch between meetings and to write minutes.
  - When meeting online, like in whereby, list the specific room link in
    the meeting invite.

### Clarity of Purpose at Meetings

  - The purpose and agenda of the meeting must be clear and made
    available to the attendees (ie, listed in the meeting event details
    on the calendar) because that allows people who don't need to be
    there, to skip.
  - You should only attend a meeting if you have a contribution to make
    (based on reading the agenda). If you just need to get information
    from the minutes. *Ask the attendees for minutes* if you can't find
    them.
  - Recurring meetings should review the previous meeting's
    follow-ups/action items. Open up the last week's minutes (or Trello
    board) and review them.
  - If you are presenting in a meeting, send out the meeting goal,
    agenda and materials (such as slides) in advance so the attendees
    can get in the right headspace. Ask for feedback on your agenda,
    such as topics they group thinks will help with the goal.
  - In general, try to make meetings shorter and more specific. If
    possible, make the goal and agenda visible in the meeting.

### Record of Meetings

  - Someone should 'chair' the meeting, which means they ensure we have
    a clear agenda and purpose (loosely, allowing for useful organic
    tangents as long as they don't dominate). This is the "Scrum Master"
    if it's a Sprint meeting.
  - Someone shold be the 'scribe'. They record any action-items and key
    information the team needs (the "output"), and make sure the minutes
    are sent to everyone present because that not only ensures the
    meeting content isn't forgotten, but further allows non-essential
    staff to skip knowing they can just review minutes.
  - Meetings should have an "output" written. For Scrum, this can simply
    be updated Trello board and KR scores. Other meetings should have a
    stream of minutes in a Google Doc that is continually added-to (most
    recent first). Here's a
    [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13iyjpQAuxwlEYiW85tJbufXrC-CAw-0AAdzO9FzHSio/edit?folder=1EJtwoxGXasYlv3UbRuzxKVNfgArFSJMn#).
    Each time you meet, fill out:

<!-- end list -->

    Meeting minutes template: (copy this for each meeting)
    Date: (202X-XX-XX)
    Agenda (topics discussed, with headlines): 
    (add bullets here)
    Follow-ups (who does what by when):
    (add bullets here)

  - Minutes are just the "headlines". What's the important point?
    Include decisions and key information. Action items can be noted,
    but should be should be transcribed into Trello where possible.
  - Send a follow-up email with these minutes if it includes any
    external stakeholders.
  - 3W rule: Meeting follow-up actions must contain the three Ws: WHO
    does WHAT by WHEN

### General Meeting Guidelines

  - Work to create an atmosphere of psychological safety. Detect
    concerns of individuals and shed light on them.
  - The maximum number of people at any meeting should be limited to 7
    (except occasional company-wide meets).
  - Avoid speaking for more than two minutes without pausing and letting
    people respond, so you can listen to your audience and steer your
    material to be more helpful. Meetings should be interactive, not
    monologues.

## Scrum Meetings

All active projects should have a Sprint meeting every 1 to 4 weeks.

  - Discuss how the current sprint will accomplish our "OKR" for the
    project.
  - See `/operations/SCRUM` for full instructions

## One-on-one Meetings

One-on-one meetings between each manager and reports should be once per
month. This is our chance to catch up on what matters, and think about
how we can work better together. People mentioning problems even once is
a gift: We can't fix systemic problems if I don't know about them.

### As an Employee

1.  This is your time to talk about whatever is on your mind. If you
    want to talk about what's going on with your life, hobbies, etc,
    that's fine. If you want to talk about work or issues at home or
    career progression, that's fine.
2.  Give feedback about what went well last month, and what didn't. How
    can we do better from now on?
3.  The discussion is confidential by default, unless there are
    suggestions or requests that come out of the discussion to relay to
    the team.

### As a Manager

1.  Practice listening. Try to contain the impulse to give advice unless
    they specifically ask for it for at least the first 10 minutes of
    the meeting.
2.  Raise anything you felt was a problem. Say how you feel about it,
    and let them lead.
3.  If they don't bring it up on their own I'll ask questions about
    emotional state and emotional reactions to situations. E.g., "How
    did you feel about what happened at Countable last month?" (be
    specific), "Are you feeling sufficiently challenged?", "What would
    you like to learn?", "What do you enjoy working on most?"
4.  TBD: Review job levels. Employees should check off each job level
    requirement, and self-promote when they reach completion of their
    current level. Give the employee a simple desription of what you
    think would really get them "to the next level". Make this as
    actionable and objective as possible, and frame it as a mentor.

### The First One-on-one

1.  On first one-on-one, ask "tell me about your life starting in
    kindergarten". Write down moments of change, decisions on direction
    and why they were made. 45 mins discussion.
2.  What are the person's dreams? Ask "what would you like to do most
    after Countable, if anything was possible? Provide 3 possible
    visions". Make dreams columns and put rows for skills necessary for
    each vision. Ask questions about everything fits together. What
    skills can be developed in their role?

### Themes

Some ideas to pick from, not needed every month.

1.  Give each other (employee first) you'd like the other to "continue"
    doing, and something to "consider" changing.
2.  Ask: Who did you work with this month, and how did that go? Why did
    it go that way?
3.  Ask: What are you learning, and from whom? What are you teaching,
    and to whom? What would you like to learn?

### Performance Reviews

Each year, the one-on-one should include performance review
self-assessment. These questions are answered by the employee in
advance.

1.  Is the purpose of your job clear to you? What is it?
2.  Write a paragraph describing what it would be like if you did
    extremely well at your job?
3.  What objectives did you have this quarter?
4.  What were some good key results, and some bad ones? Why did they go
    that way?
5.  Do you feel you took ownership of understanding and meeting (or
    exceeding) customers' needs yourself? Or expected to be given clear
    tasks.
6.  Did you seek feedback from metrics, team members, customers and
    end-users on your work?
7.  How do you feel about your performance?
8.  How do you feel about your learning and professional development?
9.  What would you like to get better at?
10. What would you like to learn, or do more of?

The manager should answer:

1.  What can you do to get to the next level in your current role?
2.  What's holding you back?

### Guild Meetings

We currently have a UX, DevOps, Operations, and Developers guild
meetings, periodically. The purpose of this meeting is:

  - Standardize, train, and define how we work in key technical
    disciplines to become the best in our fields.
  - Present and review each others' work and provide peer feedback.
  - Hold collaborative design activities such as "Mob" programming to
    create something together in the meeting.

Discuss goals for each guild and roadmap for meeting them:

  - UX - improve the end-user experience of all our work.
  - DevOps - make our work delivery automatic, frequent and reliable.
  - Developers - write better code, minimize technical debt.
  - Operations - conduct business efficiently and maintain excellent
    client relations.

### All-Hands Meetings

The entire team meets once per month to plan work pipeline and roadmap
at a high level, and practice new processes together.
