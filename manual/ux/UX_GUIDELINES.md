<div class="toctree" data-maxdepth="2" data-caption="Contents:" hidden="">

</div>

**Purpose**

Provides the Countable team with guidelines for when our work intersects
with the UX domain.

**Scope**

This document currently sets guidelines for usability, content writing,
publishing on social media, and SEO.

## Usability

Company-wide usability standards and guidelines, so we maintain a
minimum bar for our work and clients' work.

### Guidelines

  - Body text should be 16px or larger.
  - The body text font stack should fall back to Helvetica, Arial,
    sans-serif.

### User Interfaces

We should curate our own knowledge here. For now visit: [Good
UI](https://goodui.org/)

## Content Writing

This document standardizes the voice and presentation of Countable's
content writing. This may include:

  - Blog posts
  - Proposal writing
  - Copy writing on countable.ca
  - Copy writing on various Countable sites and products

### Formal Standards

To ensure professional presentation, all writing under Countable's name
must:

  - Be checked for grammar and spelling (if you are unsure of your
    grammar, please have another team member proofread)
  - Appropriately credit any work/images/references other than our own
  - When referencing Countable, use the domain countable.ca. And, use
    our simple logo glyph where possible.

### Countable's Voice

Countable's priority is to be professional, approachable, and above all,
USEFUL to our reader. This means we:

  - Use clear and direct language
  - Avoid use of industry jargon and acronyms; if they're used, provide
    definitions
  - Fact check any assertions made, particuarly technical ones - it's
    important we maintain a reputation of being experts in our field
  - Avoid spammy messaging trying to coerce or trick our reader into
    buying one of our products - our products should speak for
    themselves
  - Where appropriate, we can mention our products and their usefulness

### Blog Writing

When writing blog posts for countable.ca or one of our other sites,
please remember to:

  - Consider the site's user(s) and write "to" them: Who are they? What
    do they do? What are their needs? How can we help them?
  - Blog posts are ideally between 200-500 words
  - The more pictures, the better - if you can illustrate your points or
    advice with an image/screenshot, please do. Credit others' work
    accordingly (in most cases, a link to their site or where you found
    the image will suffice)
  - A blog's voice can be friendly and conversational, so feel free to
    add some (classy) humour, rhetorical questions, anecdotal
    experience, etc. You can include your own voice as well as the
    overall tone of Countable (see above).

## Countable's Social Media Posting Policy

The following covers what is and isn't okay to post, and who should be
posting.

### Purpose of Social Media Posting

  - Inspiration, for now, to inspire our team mates and clients with our
    work, and work we admire
  - Lead generation via followers

### Attribution

  - In order to avoid confusion between our work and others', all photos
    and designs not owned by us or in the public domain must be properly
    attributed to the original owner
  - This credit can be posted in the image caption

### Subjects

  - Work samples
  - Work that inspires us (be clear which is which)
  - Team photos
  - Industry-related memes and inspirational photos

### Instagram Aesthetic

  - Our feed is tiled in an alternating dark & light image layout
  - Wherever possible, use colours close to Countable's brand colours
    (blues, blue-greens, black and white)

### Regarding Clients' Privacy

  - No posting screenshots of code
  - Some clients' work is private, so always check with Clark before
    posting it
  - Anything already public should be ok

*Note*: For the time being, anyone other than Julie who wishes to post
on Countable's instagram should save their post as a draft for Julie's
review before posting, to ensure the above policy has been followed.

## SEO Guidelines

### Page Titles

Should be 60 chars or so. Include keywords "real estate prices" or
"housing market" Include the current Year and/or Month. Include a
quantity in the title. Include a convenience or quality word from
"quick, simple, today, X minutes, now, free, automatic, ultimate,
complete, definitive, study, step-by-step". Include an emotional word
"Amazing. Remarkable. Magic. Extraordinary." Use parentheses in your
title "( in 2018 )" "( Ultimate Guide )".

### Meta Descriptions

Should be 200 chars or so. Include foreshadowing, specific numbers, call
to action, reasons the user would visit your page. Include key
differentiator, what sets you a apart. Use a curiousity gap

### From 2018 SEO Checklist

Google has about 200 "ranking factors". Top ones include:

1.  number of similar words "on-page" in titles, url, headings, and body
    text, to the search term.
2.  how many links on the internet point back to your site/page
3.  how many people click your page in Google (CTR) by writing a good
    meta description, and how long they stay on your page (dwell
    time/engagement)

\#3 is new in 2018, and more emphasized. the other \#1 and \#2 are old
from original pagerank algorithm

Having things render only in React/Vue/Riot tags (not on server side
render) is still a disadvantage. It's also important to review WMT,
ahrefs and Google App engine for clues on what works.
