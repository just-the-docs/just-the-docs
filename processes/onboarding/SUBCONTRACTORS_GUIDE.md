# Subcontractor's Guide

**Purpose**

Make our labour practices transparent and provide support for team members who are new to subcontracting.

**Scope**

Currently covers taxes, categorization as a subcontractor, and the benefits
of incorporating.

Also check out our template [Subcontractor Agreement](SUBCONTRACTOR_AGREEMENT.md)

### Taxes

You have to claim self employment income once per year. We recommend
using [SimpleTax](https://simpletax.ca/)

1.  We suggest signing up with mint.com, as it makes tracking all your
    expenses simpler.
2.  Save all receipts for restaurants. You can deduct 50%
3.  Computer equipment, deduct % used for work.
4.  Internet, phone, deduct % used for work.
5.  Rent, deduct the percentage of the room used for work, times
    percentage of time working there.
6.  Deduct travel costs when working.
7.  Full list -[CRA Business Expenses](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/sole-proprietorships-partnerships/business-expenses)

### Categorization as a Subcontractor

1.  You should supply your own computer equipment
2.  You should determine where, when and how the work will be done.
3.  Bears risk of loss, damage or delay.

### Should You Incorporate?

This section is only if you're in Canada for now.

1.  If you're working full time, it's likely worth it, otherwise
    probably not.
2.  It costs $400ish to incorporate (form a CCPC), plus $40/yr. You also
    need to spend a day or so on extra book keeping, and a day doing an
    extra tax return each year. You'll likely want to pay an accountant
    $1000 to do the return for you, or get corporate tax software for
    $150 or up. **The real cost is something like $2000 per year when
    you start.**
3.  The main tax benefit is you can defer income to another year to stay
    in a lower tax bracket. The corporate tax rate for small businesses
    is only about 15%, so if you want to save money for several years
    it's likely a good idea to leave that portion in your corporation
    rather than pay the 45% tax rate. If you're going to save the money
    for quite a while, fill up your RRSPs first. Then start saving it in
    your CCPC.

### Things You Can Deduct From Taxes

Countable doesn't reimburse these things but if you're a subcontractor
you can deduct them from your income to avoid tax.

  - The percentage of your rent or mortgage interest used for work
    (divide the area and time you use by the total, ie 300 square feet
    out of 900 square feet, times 8 hours a day out of 24 hour a day, is
    10% of your rent)
  - Any food or beveraged purchased and consumed during work hours.
  - Any equipment you use for work.
