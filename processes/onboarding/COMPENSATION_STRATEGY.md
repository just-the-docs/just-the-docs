# Compensation Strategy and Benefits

**Purpose**

Establishes the norms and policies which guide our collaboration at Countable.

**Scope**

Covers our principles of diversity and inclusion, training, performance evaluation, and team events.

## Compensation Strategy Principles

Covers our basic principles and approach to compensating our team; not
everyone will agree with this approach, so it's important we state it
here so we don't have someone with different expectations join the team.

1.  Our approach is to pay people enough to live in reasonable comfort
    and to generally be competitive with other opportunities but we
    would rather start with lower rates and give generous raises
    compared to other companies. This is very important, because if we
    pay too high initially it will result in many staff joining because
    of the high pay, and not because they are a good fit with our many
    unusual values and methods, in order to preserve our culture.
2.  Once an employee has completed some OKRs and demonstrated they can
    push the team towards our mission, they will get a substantial
    raise. At this point, we trust they've been vetted to be a cultural
    fit. The raise will be weighted towards stock so that those who
    contribute are co-owners of Countable Web Productions Inc.
3.  This will absolutely lead to unequal pay - if you're good you'll be
    paid a lot more than someone who's still learning to be productive.
    On the positive side, this allows us to afford to hire students who
    still have some basic knowledge to develop in order to be
    productive. I think this is great because it will attract people who
    propel us forward over time, and avoid accumulating people who
    coast, by encouraging them to either improve or leave. It's much
    more motivating working with the former people.
4.  If you're assigned a change in compensation, that will take a effect
    starting in your next pay period, not immediately, nor backdated to
    past hours.

### Benefits

1.  Payment for benefits and expenses directly reimbursable will be
    included like other expenses, alongside payroll.
2.  If necessary, the company will purchase a linux computer for you.
    The specs will be commensurate with what your manager decides you
    need after discussing your job. You may not all get the same specs
    as others at the company.

#### Extended Medical

We don't currently have an extended medical group insurance plan (partly
as we don't yet have USA employees who tend to be more reliant on this),
but we'd like to help out a little when our team has dental or other
uninsured medical costs. In the future, we plan to improve our coverage
of medical costs but this is a start.

1.  Full time contractors (100h/mo or more) and employees receive 50%
    reimbursement for medical expenses, up to $1000 CAD per calendar
    year.
2.  Part time contractors (50h/mo or more) receive 30% reimbursement for
    medical expenses, up to $1000 CAD per calendar year.
