# Migrating and Upgrading

Summary
:   A site that uses `just-the-docs` (as a theme or as a remote theme) automatically
    switches to a new release, unless it is pinned to a previous version.

    This migration guide draws attention to:

    - changes that might break your site,
    - features added in the latest release, and
    - features that have become deprecated (and are likely to be removed in a future release).

This document contains instructions on how to migrate and upgrade Just the Docs sites from every minor or major version bump, starting from `v0.3.3` to `v0.4.0`.
