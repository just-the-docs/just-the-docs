# Social Media Posting Policy

**Purpose**

Make clear what should and should not be posted to social media.

**Scope**

The following covers what is and isn't okay to post, and who should be posting.

### Purpose of Social Media Posting

  - Inspiration, for now, to inspire our team mates and clients with our work, and work we admire
  - Lead generation via followers

### Attribution

  - In order to avoid confusion between our work and others', all photos and designs not owned by us or in the public domain must be properly attributed to the original owner
  - This credit can be posted in the image caption

### Subjects

  - Work samples
  - Work that inspires us (be clear which is which)
  - Team photos
  - Industry-related memes and inspirational photos

### Instagram Aesthetic

  - Our feed is tiled in an alternating dark & light image layout
  - Wherever possible, use colours close to Countable's brand colours (blues, blue-greens, black and white)

### Regarding Clients' Privacy

  - No posting screenshots of code
  - Some clients' work is private, so always check with Clark before posting it
  - Anything already public should be ok

*Note*: For the time being, anyone other than Julie who wishes to post on Countable's instagram should save their post as a draft for Julie's review before posting, to ensure the above policy has been followed.
