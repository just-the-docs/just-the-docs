## Branding Projects

### Branding Process

1.  Brand development questionnaire
2.  Discovery meeting (review other work, discuss answers to
    questionnaire). The person delivering the work must attend this
    meeting, in-person or web conference.
3.  Develop creative brief (internal). See the example Creative Brief
    below.
4.  Propose sketches and color paletttes. Cherry pick key points from
    the creative brief to present.

### Branding Guidelines

How can we get more buy-in, commitment, alignment and clarity earlier.

  - Validate the direction by reviewing other work together.
  - Inspiration board.

Demonstrating reasearch, expertise and intention in designs.

  - Provide about 3, no more than 5. "I've narrowed dozens of sketches
    down to the best 3. This is why I recommend these directions to your
    audience..."
  - Explain how the proposed designs capture their desired brand
    requirements, and appeal to the audience.
