# SEO Guidelines

**Purpose**

Identify our SEO practices.

**Scope**

Relatively outdated content.

### Basics

All our sites which are publicly available must observe the most basic SEO practices listed here.
 - The TTFB (load time) should be under a second on a fast connection.
 - There should be a unique title tag for each page, rendered on the server.
 - There should be a unique descriptive meta description tag for each page, rendered on the server.

### Page Titles

Should be 60 chars or so. Include keywords "real estate prices" or
"housing market" Include the current Year and/or Month. Include a
quantity in the title. Include a convenience or quality word from
"quick, simple, today, X minutes, now, free, automatic, ultimate,
complete, definitive, study, step-by-step". Include an emotional word
"Amazing. Remarkable. Magic. Extraordinary." Use parentheses in your
title "( in 2018 )" "( Ultimate Guide )".

### Meta Descriptions

Should be 200 chars or so. Include foreshadowing, specific numbers, call
to action, reasons the user would visit your page. Include key
differentiator, what sets you a apart. Use a curiousity gap

### From 2018 SEO Checklist

Google has about 200 "ranking factors". Top ones include:

1.  number of similar words "on-page" in titles, url, headings, and body
    text, to the search term.
2.  how many links on the internet point back to your site/page
3.  how many people click your page in Google (CTR) by writing a good
    meta description, and how long they stay on your page (dwell
    time/engagement)

\#3 is new in 2018, and more emphasized. the other \#1 and \#2 are old
from original pagerank algorithm

Having things render only in React/Vue/Riot tags (not on server side
render) is still a disadvantage. It's also important to review WMT,
ahrefs and Google App engine for clues on what works.
