# Design QA

**Purpose**

To share the importance of Design QA in digital product design, and how
it drives forward **our goal** to solve the core web technology problems
by building products that offer a context-rich user interface with
natural user experiences, so our clients can focus on delivering
solutions to their customers.

**Scope**

Gives an overview of the fields involved in Design QA, the rationale for
its importance in product development, and challenges to overcome.

## Technology is there for the user

In digital product design often the primary focus is on the technology,
with less focus on optimizing the interface and the experience for the
user.

## Human Experience and Interaction

To achieve the goal, in addition to our work, we have to make sure that
the design gets implemented as intended. Here comes the design QA.
(Other than functionality, the designer examines the appearance and
consistency.)

## Why is it important that design work is coded to closely if not perfectly match the actual designs?

## Neuroscience, psychology and consistency in design

  - To build a good product, we need to understand how human beings
    experience and interact with the world. UX and UI are based on that
    knowledge. It is about **user** interaction and **user** interface.
    **It is about the user.**
  - The more sensory and perceptual systems are engaged in the interest
    of achieving the desired goal, **the more memorable and enjoyable
    the experience, and the more likely the user is to achieve the goal
    quickly and accurately.**
  - Technology should respond to users with color, form, motion, sound,
    and tactile assets. These should be constructed in such a way as to
    optimize the user’s experience and interaction. (Everything is
    cohesive, intentional, and well-thought-out. It’s as the designer
    originally intended, and as such, each element in the design was
    created with a certain awareness of its surrounding elements.)
  - One of the main characteristics of good product design is
    **consistency.** Over time as a product is designed and developed
    inconsistencies inevitably crop up. Over time this can add up and
    turn into **“design debt.”**

## Design debt

In short, design debt is all the good design concepts or solutions that
are skipped in order to reach short-term goals. It’s all the corners we
cut during or after the design stage.

## Challenges within Design QA

  - Teams or companies do not understand or value design enough to
    create a process that fosters good design outcomes → “the feature
    works”
  - People don’t see the difference between a design and a poorly coded
    version of it → “looks good enough to me”
  - The focus of teams is on speed and feature delivery — and visual
    integrity is easier to cut than coding → “we don’t have time for it”

## The importance of Design QA in digital product design

Common ideology is to wait for Design QA until the product is almost
ready to ship but that way many features would have to be coded again to
fix UI and interaction issues, potentially causing other unforeseen
issues. If Design QA is incorporated in the process then features are
approved and signed off in one requirement ticket.

  - Keeps the UX Designer in the loop for technical issues
  - Improve collaboration
  - Helps build the correct interface as the product develops
  - Saves time
