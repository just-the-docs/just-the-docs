## DXdao Community REP Boost Guide

-   Congratulations on being nominated for a REP boost!
    
-   Reputation (REP) holders govern [DXdao](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfGgQYwL4ZrXLVshYuwH2WHeSvPFQCDXeYTzPPFReCJqJ). REP is non-transferable, so use an Ethereum address that you will have access to in the future.
    
-   Community REP boosts are 0.1% of total REP. In order to receive it, you must submit a proposal to DXdao. A step-by-step guide is below.
  
**Step 1**: Go to [Alchemy](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a), DXdao’s voting interface, and click ‘[Proposals](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/schemes)’.

#### Recommended step:  
  
To make your proposal verifiable and secure, it is ideal to add your Keybase Cryptographic Signature into your proposal.

To do this, simply follow these steps:

1.  Go to Keybase (on desktop or mobile)
    
2.  Go to “Crypto” in navigation
    
3.  Click “Sign”
    
4.  Type any message into the input field
    
5.  Copy the Signed Message to your Clipboard
    
6.  Paste the entire Signed Message into your Proposal

That’s all. Anyone using Keybase will be able to “Verify” what the Signed Message is and that it is from your Keybase handle.
