## Brand Guidelines
{: .no_toc }
Welcome to DXdao's brand asset page. These guidelines help DXdao and its products protect their brand image through appropriate external presentation. We ask that the following material be followed by all applications of the DXdao brand or its products. Any logos or images not found on this page should not be used, or confirmed with a relevant contributor in the [DXdao Discord](https://discord.gg/4QXEJQkvHH).

To get a better understanding of DXdao's history, intentions and principles, read the [DXdao Manifesto]({% link docs/Manifesto.md %}).
