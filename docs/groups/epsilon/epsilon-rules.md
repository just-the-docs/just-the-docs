# Epsilon Security Consulting Rules of Engagement [27SEP2020]
{: .no_toc }

# Common Sense Statute

  We're all about having fun here, so we keep the rules pretty limited, don't make us change that. Attempts to circumvent the rules through loopholes or through attempts at rule lawyering will result in finding yourself returned to a safehub. Please don't be a pain in the ass.

# The Big 4

  We as Epsilon firmly believe in giving people chances at proper conduct and behavior, and strive to provide people second chances even based on past actions in the SLMC. Sometimes the extent of those actions extend beyond even our ability to brush it aside. The following are cases that will result in a permanent ban from Araxia and all Epsilon associated regions.
  
    • Distribution of identifying real-life information about others (doxxing)
    • GPU crashing or other griefing intended to damage real-life hardware
    • Content Theft via abuse of permissions failures or copybotting and/or distribution of ill gotten content
    • Mass abuse reporting
  
# General Conduct

1. Client Side Assists - Usage of Wireframe, Hitboxes or disabling of prejump are forbidden. If the question is risen that these are in use, they will be requested to be disabled or the offending user will be placed upon an auto returner or autokiller until compliance is met. Further refusal will result in a temporary timeout. 

2. Harrassment - While some level of shit talk is acceptable, we strive to avoid being toxic and cultivating an environment of such. We're all here to have fun and there is no need to attempt to "tilt" people for no reason as its assumed we're all adults.

3. Griefing - Griefing can be defined as intentionally causing script time or fps of the sim and/or users on the region to be decreased by intentional means. Crashing the sim applies in this case as well. This will automatically result in a 24 hour ban minimum.

4. Sithacking - Sithacking or using personal teleports to access generally unaccesible areas to the public is not allowed. First offense will result in being shot, following will result in being placed on an autokiller or placed on a temporary timeout off sim.

5. Safe Zones - Both home set locations at the corner of the sims are are safe zones. These are marked clearly by spawn doors or via a line on the ground. Accidental single cases will be forgiven but continued cases of firing into or attempting to enter these zones will result in a warning, then a time out and so on until the point is understood.

6. Avatar Flight - Flying around is not permitted. You will be hit with a seeker missile.

7. Movement Enhancers - Sprints are allowed so long as they have a minimum 5 second cooldown minimum between use. Boostpacks are disallowed until the sim is completed and all appropriate methods of traversal are added. Airstrafes are disallowed.


## Infantry Weapons

1. Persistent Effects - Any persistent effect used must last a limit of 30 seconds and not replicate itself. This is enforced on a case by case basis due to the good old limitations of Second Life and timers. 

2. General Gun Rules - Guns and the like must use a mag size reasonable for the type of weapon it is, and force a reload or overheat after that round limit is exceeded for a reasonable period of time. If during combat it is noticed that a weapon is not reloading at all, and it is not a result of simulator performance issues we reserve the right to request it be replaced.

3. Raycast Weaponry - Hybrid raycast is disallowed at Araxia. Raycast must use a reasonable offset for the type of weapon it is with partial damage configured for any offsets.
    - Agentlist weaponry is disallowed. If found to be using it and attempting to hide it, you will be warned and the item added to a blacklist.
    - Sensor based Shotguns - Shotguns should be a reasonable distance for the type of weapon it is. An automatic shotgun should not extend out to the maximum range of a sensor.        This is stupid. You are stupid for doing it.
    - RC Offsets exceeding .05 are disallowed without prior testing and approval. 
    
4. Explosives and Effects - All explosives and AoE effects are required to do a raycast check to ensure that targets hit by it are not behind a wall or other obstruction. If the question is raised that RC checks are not in used the Defending OIC reserves the right to request the item be checked and will be permitted if theres no issue or put on banned equipment enforcer until we are sure an update has been applied to fix the issue.
    - AN HUD is not permitted due to constant raycast check failures on the frag grenade.
    
5. Usage of Closed Group Gear - Gear from closed groups is permitted on a case by case basis. See below for specific preapproved or banned cases:
    - Coercion - Permitted but use restraint. Do not use the dumb dumb av flying sword.
    - AN - AN CAR and PDW are permitted for use as they have been extensively tested.
    - Chaos Decretum - BANNED, Gear has not been appropriately kept up to date to current standards.
    
6. Riot Shields - Permitted but since it apparently needs to be stated clearly, Riot shields must not exceed 50 LBA HP and must go phantom or deactivate when firing. IE: DONT FIRE WHEN SHIELD IS UP RETARDS.

7. Grapples - At this time Grapples are not permitted. 

8. Seeker Weaponry - Seekers must make use of the newly adopted Seeker system developed by Sin and Criss Ixtar to allow for unified flare use. If there are questions on this rule as OIC for clarification. Seekers must also provide a lock on tone to the user being targeted.

9. Breaches - Breaches are not permitted at this time. In the future they will be allowed once the Objective system is completed.

10. Repairs - LBA Repairs can be completed by avatar or vehicle but not through automatic means. Remote repairs are permitted up to a maximum range of 10m


## Vehicles

1. LBA Variants Rule - Legacy Armor types are not permitted for use at Araxia. We currently allow LBA variants that are hosted on Github or provided through open channels for transparency reasons. If utilizing directional armor there must be a way to report back the ratio modifiers on the armor per side.

2. Armored Ground Vehicles - Ground vehicles must use an LBA version (LBA, LBA Light) based on the class of vehicle it is. A jeep realistically should not have full LBA let alone more than 25 HP. Tanks and the like are permitted up to 450 HP again, based on the class of tank and movement of the vehicle. 

3. Armored Aircraft - Aircraft armor is limited to 200HP For gunship types and 500 HP for Fleetships. There should not be armor at ALL on fighters or basic bombers. 

## Deployables

1. Deployable Health - HP Must be limited to 50 as a general standard. There are specific cases below that can stray from this rule.
    - Walls are permitted up to a maximum HP of 100. Exceeding this requires a user to be standing nearby to complete building. 
    - Interceptors should not exceed an HP of 25. They already block explosives, making them an irritant to shoot as well is super lame.
    - Breaches when permitted should never be over 25 HP Inverse LBA.
    - "Engineering Kit" Generators are permitted to have a maximum of 250 HP.

2. Deployable Limits - Deployables are limited to 2 of each type per person. Interceptors are restricted to 1 per person due to the strength of them.

3. Mines - Mines are limited to 5 per person maximum. Mines must be able to receive and be destroyed by LBA or bullet damage and have a reasonable sensor for activation on them. 

4. Sit Barricades - Sit Barricades are permitted but each person gets 1 per life unless persistent memory of health is used to continue the last health available on the barricade when being moved and must use LBA Light. This can be adjusted on a case by case basis.

5. Automated Turrets - Automated turrets are permitted as long as they are connected to an energy source that is able to be destroyed. Otherwise they are not permitted at Araxia. Anti-Air turrets requiring a lockon must also provide a lockon tone before firing and while missile is in transit to its location.

6. NPCs - NPCs are permitted on a case by case basis. HP is limited to 25 LBA-L. Ask the defending OIC for approval. 


# Banned Equipment

  If an item is on this list it is likely considered to be super fucking lame or just generally pointless to be used in the current day and age. There are some cases of simply untrustworthy creators that may also be added to this list or removed as trustworthiness is established.
