# Contributor Onboarding

___

## HOW TO ENGAGE

1. **Chat with DXdao’s contributors.** You may know a few of DXdao's contributors or know someone who knows them, and they're a great place to start if you're new to the community. You should also introduce yourself on the <a href="https://keybase.io/team/dx_dao" target="_blank">DXdao Keybase</a> and speak with the Contributor Experience Squad. Feel free to ask questions and share your interests!
    
2. **Look at [Open Positions and Bounties]({% link docs/ContributorHub/open-positions-and-bounties.md %}).** Reach out on Keybase to connect with the Contributor Experience Squad if you see an open opportunity that piques your interest and suits your skill set. You may also want to contact the Squad Leader for the position you're interested in for any additional details.
    
3.  **Attend meetings.** Check our [Weekly Meeting Schedule]({% link docs/Meetings/index.md %}) and attend a meeting in the upcoming week. Make sure to attend a meeting that relates to your position of interest, as well as our Community Call for an introduction.
    
4.  **Draft a Trial Period Proposal.** Create a 2-Week Trial Period Proposal with the Contributor Experience Squad (or any other full-time contributor you're chatting with). This proposal could be for part-time work (<40 hours per week), full-time work (40 hours per week), or a specific project. To clarify your scope of work, contact the Squad Leader for the position you're interested in.
    
5.  **Post your proposal to <a href="https://daotalk.org/c/dx-dao/15" target="_blank">DAOtalk</a>.** Along with a successful 2-Week Trial Period, your draft proposal will contain your next 2 months of work (making it a 2.5-month period). The 2-Week Trial Period is at a 50% compensation rate and the following 2 months at an 80% compensation rate. See the Contributor Compensation and Contributor Proposal Sections for how to draft and submit a contributor proposal.
    
6.  **Submit your proposal on-chain.** Once your proposal is posted on DAOtalk, please allow up to 7 days for contributors to give feedback on your draft proposal and for you to make any necessary changes. Once this is completed, you can post your proposal on Alchemy and request compensation. See the Contributor Proposal Guide on how to submit your first proposal on Alchemy.

## CONTRIBUTION TYPES & TIME COMMITMENTS

DXdao is a growing community that welcomes contributors in a variety of contexts and for a range of time commitments. This section outlines the various contribution levels with DXdao.

### Contribution Types:

-   Bounties: DXdao posts for tasks that the community needs specialized assistance with. If you complete a task for which a bounty was posted, show your proof of work, and submit a daotalk.org post linking to the bounty. The DXdao community will then signal for you to go ahead with the Alchemy bounty proposal to receive payment.
    
-   Contract Basis: All contributors not seeking payment for a claimed bounty are employed through DXdao on a contract basis. That is contributors submit a proposal for a scope of work to be completed over a set period of time and are compensated for their contributions. The scope of work stated in the contributor proposal creates a contract with DXdao where 50% of compensation is to be paid at the passing of the contributor proposal and the remaining 50% of compensation is to be paid at the conclusion of the work period.
   
-   Past Work: It has happened that community members become so involved in DXdao that they almost accidentally end up doing work that the community agrees should be compensated through the DAO. If this is you, please reach out to community members and make a post on Alchemy describing your past work and requested compensation. We appreciate your efforts and believe you should be compensated accordingly.
  
### Time Commitments:
    
-   Full-time: DXdao considers anyone that is working 40 hours per week to be a full-time contributor. Any full-time contributor will be working on a contract, non-hourly, basis, and so is exempt from claiming overtime hours.

-   Part-time: any contributor that works no more than 20 hours per week is a part-time contributor. Any part-time contributors will be working on a contract, non-hourly, basis, and so is exempt from claiming overtime hours.

-   Percent (%) of Time: Some contributors have other commitments and so have opted to commit a percentage of 40 hours per week. A contributor's compensation, based on the Worker Compensation Table, is then calculated on a pro rata basis.

For example, if a contributors commits to working 30 hours per week at a level 4 experience level ($7,000 per month in ETH), her salary for the month is adjusted to 75% of $7,000, which would be $5250 in ETH. The same adjustment is also made to the DXD vesting payment.

## TRIAL PERIOD

### 2-Week Trial Period

There is a 2-week trial period at the start of a new contributor's first pay period. The first pay period is 2.5 months. The point of the 2-week trial period is to confirm that the contributor is “who they say they are,” meaning she is able and willing to complete the required scope of work. Think of this as an anti-sybil defense.

The trial period is paid at a 50% of salary rate. This also affects REP distribution, meaning REP will be distributed at a 50% rate for the 2-week trial period. To learn more about how to determine your salary rate and REP distribution, see the Worker Compensation section, below.

### During the Trial Period

The contributor should check-in with her squad and / or onboarding guide every couple of days. Other DXdao contributors will also give feedback on completed work during this time.

### At the End of the Trial Period

The contributor will meet with her squad guide to discuss her trial period review. This is an opportunity to determine progress and appropriate work fit. If the worker is able to complete her described scope of work, perfect. Keep doing what you’re doing. We welcome your further contributions to DXdao.

However, if the contributor is not able to complete her described scope of work, the contributor will be compensated for the work she has completed in good faith during the 2-week trial period. The community will notify the contributor that she is no longer a contributor at DXdao and will not be compensated for future work.

Work completed in good faith is determined by the squad leader, all relevant contributors that have personal knowledge of what the contributor did or did not complete, and any other relevant community members that have personal knowledge of the work completed by the contributor during the trial period.
