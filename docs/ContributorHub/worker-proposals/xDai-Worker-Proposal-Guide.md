## Alchemy Worker Proposal Guide [xDai]

  

### Intro:

-   Congratulations on getting the signal to submit a worker proposal to DXdao!
    
-   At this point, you’ve started the onboarding process, posted a draft of your worker proposal on [daotalk.org](https://daotalk.org), and the proposal was signalled for an on-chain DXdao vote.
    
-   For details on what should be in the worker proposal, go to DXdao’s Contributor Guidelines -- Worker Compensation section.
    
-   After the [xDai authorization proposal](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x2a4f24200eb1ef626e9aea29bad2494689f979c00c6fff17b5b0cd38712be426), workers can now submit proposals on xDXdao base on xDai and save gas.
    
### When to Submit Your Worker Proposal:

-   A boosted worker proposal takes approximately 5 days to pass.
    
-   If a proposal is not boosted, the voting period will last 21 days.
    
-   A proposal is generally eligible to be boosted 1 day after the proposal is posted on Alchemy.
    
-   **The Point**:  *You should post your alchemy proposal 1 week before you intend to receive payment for your work with DXdao, and the proposal must be boosted in order for the voting period to shrink to 1 week.*
    
-   You can boost your own worker proposal once it is eligible to be boosted.

### What You’ll Need:

-   Your ETH account address on xDai where you will receive your ETH payment when the proposal passes.

**Step 3**: Calculate your ETH/Dai, DXD and REP compensation payment

-   Use [this calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18K5jVn8HmwQZ9Ve48S90vQAYklIm0heKTTDGHfWXc5s/edit?usp=sharing) to calculate. Fill in the Blue squares with your information.
    
-   Calculate the amount of ETH/Dai for your worker proposal payment using your determined monthly compensation level. See [Contributor Guidelines](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXwDuxLzMdyg3eEsYM95BJscFrHECsTaKaSRJxjK3njqv/DXdao%20Contributor%20Guidelines.pdf) -- DXdao Compensation Table. Find the ETH price if you are requesting WETH
    
-   For DXD, find the monthly amount on Contributor Guidelines, and then divide that number by the all-time price of DXD on Coingecko (currently $523). This must be vested. While we build a vesting contract system, please record the # of DXD for your worker proposal in the proposal text
    
-   For REP, each worker is due 0.1667% of mainnet REP each month. As the total amount of REP changes, the amount of REP to each worker is noted at the beginning of each month on the xDai Authorization forum thread. Use this number for your REP award on xDai (prorated if part-time) and also note the main net REP award amount in the proposal text.
    
-   xDai proposals cannot reward mainnet REP - awards will be batched and sent to multiple addresses once a quarter. You can ask for your monthly contributor REP award in xDai REP. This will allow you to vote on proposals on xDai. .
    

  

**Step 4**: Click on the ‘+ New Proposal’ button in the top right corner and connect your wallet.

**Note**: Submitting a proposal will require gas, but don’t worry! DXdao refunds 75% of gas costs. [Find more information here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-governance-refunds-round-2/2361)

  

### Recommended step:  
  
To make your proposal verifiable and secure, it is ideal to add your Keybase Cryptographic Signature into your proposal.

To do this, follow these steps:

1.  Go to Keybase (on desktop or mobile)
    
2.  Go to “Crypto” in navigation
    
3.  Click “Sign”
    
4.  Type any message into the input field
    
5.  Copy the Signed Message to your Clipboard
    
6.  Paste the entire Signed Message into your Proposal
    
Anyone using Keybase will be able to “Verify” what the Signed Message is and that it is from your Keybase handle.
