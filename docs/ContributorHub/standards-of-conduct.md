# Standards of Conduct

___

## Diversity

DXDao strongly values diversity and is committed to equal opportunity and inclusion in all of its practices and policies. In order to provide equal opportunities to all individuals, contributor decisions for DXdao will be based on merit, qualifications, abilities, and past contributions. DXdao does not discriminate contributor opportunities or practices because of race, ethnicity, culture, color, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation or preferences, nationality, age, socioeconomic status, or dis/ability.

DXdao will make accommodations for qualified individuals with known disabilities unless doing so would result in an undue hardship. This policy governs all aspects of contribution, including selection, job assignment, compensation, discipline, termination, and access to benefits and training.

DXdao expressly prohibits any form of harassment or discrimination. Workers or community members with questions or concerns about discrimination on DXdao forums, meetings, chats, or any other form of communication are encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of the DXdao community. Anyone can raise concerns without fear of reprisal. Anyone found to be engaging in such behavior will be subject to the appropriate corrective action found in the below Enforcement Guidelines.

## Conflicts of Interest

Workers have an obligation to the DXdao community to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest. DXdao’s conflict of interest policy establishes only the framework within which DXdao chooses to conduct business. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide workers with general information so that you can get further direction from other community members when you need guidance on issues related to a possible conflict of interest.

Workers may not engage in outside activities that conflict with, or could be perceived as conflicting with, the interests of DXdao, including but not limited to:  

-   Using your position to influence a decision that may result in personal gain for you, a relative, or a friend as a result of DXdao’s business dealings.

-   Having a financial relationship or financial interest with a supplier, vendor, or competing entity, employee, or other entity having business dealings with DXdao that may negatively impact DXdao.
    
-   Using DXdao’s name as a part of any outside promotional campaign or other business endeavor.
    
## Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing

Workers have an obligation to act in good faith and to deal fairly with other DXdao workers and contributors. Examples of not acting in good faith are the following:

-   Pretending to be someone else for the purpose of obtaining a position with DXdao.  

-   Falsely claiming to have completed work that was in fact never completed or completed in a substandard manner for the purpose of receiving compensation.
    
## Contributor Covenant

Additionally, all DXdao community members are expected to abide by the following modified Contributor Covenant where applicable. This is a Code of Conduct developed specifically for Open Source Communities. 


# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

___

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of

response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include posting via an official social media
account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement on the respective 
social channel. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
