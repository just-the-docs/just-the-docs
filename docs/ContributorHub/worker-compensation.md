## WORKER COMPENSATION

### Base Compensation in ETH or Stablecoins 

Contributors may choose when to receive their ETH / Stablecoin payment in their worker proposal.

### 50/50 Payment Structure

Often, contributors request 50% payment at the passing of their Alchemy proposal and the remaining 50% on the date that their worker proposal period ends. However, this is not a fixed standard and may be requested differently depending on the circumstances. If you’re not requesting a 50/50 split, provide justification for a different payment structure and request feedback from community members.

### DXD Compensation on Top of Base Compensation

DXD is locked with 50% vesting after 1 year of the worker contract start date, and the remaining 50% is vested through a linear schedule after the 1-year cliff, fully vested at 2 years. Contributors may not request liquid DXD in their worker proposals.

### Determination of Price

ETH payment is determined by the price of ETH at the date and time of proposal submission. Because of the high volatility of ETH price, workers may also determine the ETH payment based on the weekly average of the ETH price.

DXD payment is set to the all-time high (ATH) price in US dollars on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dxdao).

### REP

Contributors that commit at least 40 hours per week to DXdao receive 0.1667% REP per month. Contributors that are working less than 40 hours per week should calculate the amount of REP they receive in proportion to the amount of hours per week they contribute to DXdao. Like payments, REP is requested on a 50/50 basis, at the beginning of the work period and at the end of the work period in the worker’s second payment request.

New workers (2.5 month period): Like your salary, REP is calculated on a prorated basis. For the 2-week trial period, you may claim 0.0417% REP (50% rate). REP for the first two (2) months of work is prorated to an 80% rate at 0.1333% per month.

-   In the first worker proposal on Alchemy, request 0.175% REP for your first 1.5 months of work.
    
-   In the worker payment request on Alchemy at the end of your work period, request 0.1333% REP for the second month of work.

Workers that have completed their first 2.5 months with DXdao: You will request one (1) month of REP (0.1167%) in the first worker proposal and one (1) month of REP (0.1167%) in the worker payment request at the end of the 2-month work period, totalling two (2) months of REP. Adjust this logically if your work period is for longer or shorter than the standard 2-month period.

A single worker may receive a maximum of 4% REP for their paid contributions to DXdao.

### Calculating Monthly Compensation For Worker Proposals:

1.  Pick your experience Level 1 through 5, based on experience guidelines (below) and in consultation with the DXdao community.
    
2.  Select Base Salary + DXD from the DXdao Compensation Table (below).
    
3.  If opting for part-time work, multiply these numbers by % of time or intended hrs/week divided by 40.
    
4.  Determine 50% of full salary, if during the 2-week trial period, AND determine 80% of salary for the following two (2) months for the first worker proposal. After the first worker proposal for 2.5 months of work, salary is paid at 100% rate.

### Experience Guidelines:

1.  `I’m new! I don’t have many marketable life skills, but I’m passionate about DXdao and eager to learn.`
    
2.  `I have some work experience, but I have not yet developed specialized skills. Perhaps I have worked in a related industry, but I might lack direct experience in Web3/DeFi/DAOs. I’m eager to get more expertise in my vertical.`
    
3.  `I’ve been around the block and know how to work independently, but I still need help coming up with a scope of work and working with people outside of my area of focus. I’m eager to grow horizontally and vertically.`
    
4.  `I know what’s going on and some (maybe even myself) would consider me an “expert” on my specialty. I can work with different stakeholders and drive initiatives internally. I’m eager to fill gaps in my skill set.`
    
5.  `I have deep expertise in a particular vertical or have direct experience that is relevant to Web3/DeFi/DAOs. I’m eager to further the mission of DXdao and work with other engaging and ambitious people.`
