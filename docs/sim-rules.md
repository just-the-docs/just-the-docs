# CHAOS INDIVISVM 
{: .no_toc }
- Sim Rules

Updated: 08/13/2020 - August 13th, 2020

Authors: Dread Hudson, Hadet Sonnenkern, & Sam Huntsman

The most up to date ruleset will always be available at : 
https://docs.chaos.church/docs/sim-rules/

Don't be stupid, Don't try abusing loopholes. If you're acting like a little kid, You will be treated like a little kid.
If your group declares its intentions to be obnoxious little assholes don't expect any quarter to be given, You are responsible for who you associate with.

# General Rules - TL;DR VERSION

## I. Don't be an Asshole:
Examples of this include:
1. Intentional Primshooting
2. Using any form of Clientside Assistance. Wireframe, ARC, Collision Skeletons, Hitboxes, etc. If you are discovered to be doing this you're gonna get griefed for pretty much forever.
3. Using anything you specifically ban in your sim. If you think it's bullshit enough to ban it, You shouldn't ever be using it.
4. If you have a ratio rule, not following it here. If you're going to enforce it in your sim, you are expected to abide by it in ours.
5. Not listening to what the OIC says; If you're being told not to do something then don't do it.
6. Renaming equipment to get around the banned equipment enforcer. If it's on that, it's on it for a good reason, and trying to evade it may get your entire raid party griefed.
7. Engaging people in non combat areas. The VR room is off limits for combat, as is the armoury and AFK room. If people are in these areas, they are busy doing other shit. If you kill people in these areas, you will be removed for a week minimum.
8. No AOs that are not included in your gun, and absolutely no flippy ninja jump animations. This is SL military army mans, not Magical girl naruto RP.
9. Under no circumstances should you have a video of you punching your own feces.
# II. Equipment:

(Any device deployed on the field of battle)
    
## ALL EQUIPMENT:
1. You are to use the most up to date versions of your gear at all times.
    * If you are using an outdated piece of equipment in order to gain an advantage over someone, you will be shit on.
            
## Weaponry :

### GUNS:
1. Don't use Mono bullets. We will revoke your ability to rez bullets if you do this shit.
    * We've shown ALL of you why Mono bullets are a bad idea, and it takes literally 10 seconds to swap a script from mono 
2. Don't use Hue cannons; these are guns with very quick reloads or none at all, high magazine capacity, tight spread, and high rates of fire all combined. We put a lot of effort into actually balancing our weaponry, and free equipment is provided in the hub.
3. ALL WEAPONRY MUST HAVE A VISIBLE PROJECTILE! 
    * THIS MEANS - YOUR RAYCAST WEAPONRY MUST HAVE A VISUAL TRAIL, LIKE A LASER, FROM THE POINT OF EMISSION TO POINT OF CONTACT
    * ALL BULLETS MUST BE CLEARLY VISIBLE, NO INVISIBLE OR NEARLY INVISIBLE BLACK BULLETS! 
    * Exceptions to THIS specific rule will be made if you do something INTERESTING with your suppressed weapons, on a case by case basis.
    * If your Suppressed weapon slows the RATE OF FIRE and VELOCITY of your weapon, we will consider allowing it!
                
### MELEES:
1. All melee weapons must utilize raycast checks to avoid killing avatars through obstructions.
2. Melee weapons should not have a kill range that exceeds 6 Meters from the attacking avatar
3. Melee weapons should have a cooldown between swings. Unless it's a chainsaw that does partial damage, you shouldn't be swinging as fast as you can mash the button. Automatic firerate for melee is gay.
4. No auto triggering melees. Triggering melee requires user input. Do note, however, that a big robot physically stepping on someone is a roadkill and not a melee.
                
### REPAIR TOOLS:
1. Repairs may only be used at a distance of 5m or less from the object being repaired.
2. Repair tools must replace either a main-hand or offhand weapon.
3. Repairs given may not exceed 12 hp/sec under any circumstances.

## Movement Enhancers : 

* No one should be Avatar Flying around the sim, and your avatar shouldn't be able to jump and fly from one end of the sim to the other, that's not the kind of combat this sim was designed for. 
* If you want your Jump Pack approved contact Hadet Sonnenkern or Dread Hudson, The final decision is up to them.
            
1. Dodgerolls must be a standard 10 meters or less, and may not be triggered mid air. 
2. Grappling hooks may be used only IF they are of the reeling variety. Examples of this are the issued Chaos Indivisvm grappling hook and the DECO Hook. Bathooks are not allowed!
3. Jetpacks & Jump packs - If you used an unauthorized jetpack or jump pack, you will be locked in place for the remainder of the raid, or until you write us a six paragraph apology letter.
    * The Stormboy Pack, other than the issued Chaos Indivisvm Assault Pack, is the only allowed jump pack in our sim. The ONLY difference between the two is the Model.
        - Stormboy Packs are rezzed out based on our current number of Assault Packs, or a ratio of 1 pack to 5 defenders, Whichever one is higher. 
        - WHAT THIS MEANS is that if we have 3 defending, but all of them have Assault Packs on, you also get 3 Stormboy packs.
        - HOWEVER, if none of them have Assault Packs on, tough shit, you will get ONE pack per 5 defenders.

## Deployables:

### Interceptors:
1. If you are using an grenade interceptor that is intercepting munitions through objects we will grief it and you. 
2. You must also utilize checks to ensure your interceptor does not intercept vehicles, such as planes. Ask, and you shall receive the code snippet.
3.  We prefer if Interceptors are Sensor based as opposed to using VolumeDetect., the reason being to cut down on Collision Events. 
            
### Artillery:  
1. Artillery may not auto-target avatars or objects.
2. Artillery may not utilize seeking munitions.
3. Artillery must have an operator within 10 meters, or a visible and built upon upgrade that allows it to fire and reload automatically. 
            
### Teleporters:
1. All Teleporters must have a SOLID hitbox of AT LEAST 1m x 1m x 1m
2. Drop Pods are also considered teleporters, and must have a end beacon that adheres to the same size requirement as teleporters.
            
### Auto Turrets:
1. During Capture-the-Flag : Turrets are limited to 3 per side
2. Turrets must have a lockon time of GREATER THAN 1 second, PREFERABLY adjusted to be longer the farther away a target is.
3. Turrets must not actively target through objects.
4. Turrets that deliver seeking munitions MUST utilize some sort of power grid system. We will be the arbiters of whether that system is sufficiently balanced.
5. We REQUIRE you to have specialized turrets for specialized things (if you use them at all), instead of using 'jack of all trades' style turrets.
    * i.e. Anti-Air Turrets should not attack ground targets.
            
## Repair capable Deployables
Are not allowed at this time. 

This includes drones and deployable repair auras, basically any deployable that repairs anything else, regardless if it's armor, other deployables, or anything else you can think of. The only thing doing repairs should be a dedicated repair tool.

A deployable that repairs itself will NEVER be allowed in a Chaos Sim.

## Munitions:

### Direct Munitions:
* (Bullets, Rockets, etc, what makes contact and/or deploys radial munitions)

1. Standard damage enabled projectiles (Bullets) must die on collision with solid surfaces.
2. Projectile Rotations should be locked through `llSetStatus(STATUS_ROTATE_X|STATUS_ROTATE_Y|STATUS_ROTATE_Z,0);` on any non arcing munition, excluding seekers. 
    Munitions that arc through the air, ie grenades, mortars, etc, should have X and Z locked regardless. This is to prevent projectiles from wildly ricocheting.
3. Explosive projectiles should be no smaller than 0.06 meters, height and widthwise, non-phantom, and should be able to be countered by all interception systems. The counter to interception systems is Chaff, not making your explosive projectiles the same size as regular bullets. Low yield explosive bullets are the only exception to this rule, see #6 of this section.
4. Projectile Density should be set to 1000 or lower, to prevent bullets from bouncing physical vehicles.
5. Munitions must be fired along a interceptable trajectory. Under no circumstances can something warp from position A to position B with something between it.
6. Fully automatic explosive bullets and Fully automatic AT bullets must be fired from an appropriate platform, and scaled to the nature of that platform. These are the rules for the PROJECTILES.
    * Man Portable weapons capable of firing Explosive bullets should fire at a relatively low rate of fire, Less than 400 RPM for 'Rifles' and 700 for 'LMG's. Anything exceeding 200 RPM may not be capable of AT.
    * Man Portable weapons capable of firing AT bullets should fire an even lower rate of fire than Explosive platforms - Don't melt tanks with rifles, that shit is legit gay. AT output should scale based on your RPM as well. Ie. 5 AT Should require 60 RPM, scale from there.
    * Man Portable AT bullets MAY NOT also have an explosion.
    * Vehicle mounted weapons may have a higher rate of fire, according to the mounted weapon. AT output should scale based on your RPM, with handicaps such as being fixed allowing for higher AT or RPM.
    * Specialization is key to balancing full auto explosive & AT weaponry. If it's good at one thing it should be shit at the other. If it does both AT and Explodes, it better be a slow as shit firing autocannon, a GAU-8 on a close air support plane, or from a fleetship.
            
8. Seeking Munitions must adhere to the following:
    * Seeking Munitions must utilize physical movement, and must comply with the explosive munition hitbox regulation.
    * Seeking Munitions must utilize a raycast line-of-sight check for detected targets, and must not lock on if said raycast is obstructed.
    * Seeking Munitions that target airborne units or vehicles must utilize a raycast height check, and must not lock if the target is under 15 meters from a surface for an Avatar, or 5 meters for a Vehicle.
    * Seeking Munitions that target ground based vehicles must utilize a raycast height check, and must not lock if the target is beyond 15 meters from a surface.
    * Seeking Munitions may only proximity detonate on targeted aircraft and airborne avatars, and only within 5 meters of said locked on target.
    * Seeking Munitions may only deliver AT to the object they collide with. 25 AT Maximum for avatar deployed launchers.
    * Seeking Munition delivery systems may ONLY target ground-based vehicles OR airborn targets. Never both, under any circumstances. Take your do-everything weapons elsewhere.
                    
9. Flak Munitions, defined as any proximity detonating non-seeking projectile, must adhere to the following:
    * Flak Munitions must utilize a raycast line-of-sight check for detected avatars, and must not detonate on if said raycast is obstructed.
    * Flak Munitions must utilize a raycast height check, and must not detonate if the target is under 15 meters from a surface
    * Flak Munitions may only proximity detonate within 10 meters of a detected entity.
    * Flak Munitions may do a maximum of 5 AT to a detected entity. Please scale according to the firing platform, At full auto, 5 AT is plenty for a vehicle, but unreasonable for infantry. You do not want to have a Hydra with 10 AT flak rounds swatting all your aircraft out of the sky.
    * Flak Munitions may not distinguish between friend or foe.
                    
### Radial Munitions:  
* (Explosions, Gas, Smoke, Etc. Anything that isn't a bullet)

1. All munitions, excluding the single instance (sec. 2) described below, must utilize raycast checks to avoid killing avatars through obstructions.
2. High yield explosives, such as those fired from an appropriate artillery platform, at a velocity of under 50 meters a second, and that are fully effected by gravity, may do partial damage (based on distance), through obstructions.
3. Under no circumstance may a munition be Group Safe. Scripted objects intended to render someone immune from a particular form of munition (such as gasmasks) count as that munition being group-safe (we cannot control nor trust you on its responsible use).
4. Fully automatic explosive bullets and fully automatic AT bullets must be fired from an appropriate platform. These are the rules for the EXPLOSIONS.
    * Man portable full auto explosions should be limited to a range of 3m or less, 100 Damage @ 1m, falloff to 0 by 3m
    * Vehicle mounted full auto explosions may have a larger radius, according to the mounted weapon. Error on the side of caution, nobody wants to deal with 5m kill explosions being machinegunned at them.
    * Fully automatic explosive bullets may not have splash AT.
    * Man portable full auto AT bullets may not have any splash damage.
5. Repair munitions are not allowed.
    * Currently, only dedicated infantry carried repair tools may repair.
6. If your group cannot meet these standards, you will be restricted to using the free Combat HUD provided in the attacker spawn.

# III. Armour
 (Anything that tracks HP)
1. Due to inconsistent scripting, people still having their armour and movement functions in the same script, and the fact that it is now a COMMUNITY STANDARD with nearly
    * every ACTIVE group having adopted it, LBA Systems Sourced from the **MASTER** branch on the official LBA GitHub Repository are the only accepted armor systems in this Sim. If you are testing an update to one of these systems, please notify the OIC ahead of time. 
    * Future forks of the LBA project are either still in development or not open-sourced well enough and are not allowed at this time. Unmerged Pull Requests are not officially supported.
    *  Non-Directional LBA Systems must not reduce any damage put into it, except for when the anti-grief system, USING STOCK VALUES, is triggered.
    * Directional LBA/LBHD will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis until a proper automated system and/or standard for how modifiers are handled is decided upon. Don't be stupid and your stuff won't get banned. 
1.LBA Light Systems must accept all collisions over 10 meters a second.
2. Pure LBA should be reserved for: 
    * TANKS, FLEETSHIPS, AND HEAVY DEPLOYABLE COVER (Bunkers and Walls)
3. LBA Light should be used in lighter & small vehicles, such as: 
    * GUNSHIPS, HOVERCRAFT, AND MECHS      
4. Vehicle sitbases must accurately track and maintain cohesion with your vehicle hitbox. Your sitbase and avatar must also be centered in a solid portion of your vehicle.
5. Vehicle Hitboxes must accurately represent the visual model.
6. No HP tracking object may be Volume Detect. If any portion of a deployable is utilizing volume detect, a seperate HP tracking SOLID hitbox must accompany it. This hitbox must be AT LEAST 1x1x1m in size.
7. AT Emitters, for damaging collision based systems, must be PHANTOM, and may not lock vehicles in place or bounce them around via high density AT prims.
8. Keep your Armour script & Movement scripts in your vehicles seperate, for the best possible responsiveness when taking damage. This is mandatory.
9. Armour may not self-repair under any circumstances. This includes passengers inside a vehicle repairing ANY vehicle with otherwise legal tools.
    * The only exception to this are riot shields, which may only be carried by infantry, and may heal ONE (1) point of damage per 2.5 seconds until they are either destroyed or not in use. Riot shields 'Respawning' after being broken may heal TWO (2) points of damage per 2.5 seconds. 'Respawning' riot shields must be inactive until FULLY recovered. Riot shields may repair to full (respawn) upon avatar death.
    
* If your Armour scripts consistently fail to responsively & accurately take damage, you will be provided with one of our design.
* If your Sitbase scripts consistently fail to responsively & accurately track and move with your hitbox, you will be provided with one of our design.
        
## Vehicle Balance: 
Because people are getting fucking retarded about it, Here's a refresher course in "why is my gunship being thrown off sim?" or "why are all of my prims being returned?".

1. Armour Values should reflect the size, speed, and firepower of the vehicle being used. If your tank has an excess of 500 HP and several powerful weapon systems, It should naturally be moving at a snails pace.
2. This applies even more so for gunships, because gunships are the bane of combat and are currently used exclusively as "i want to win" ships.
3. Exposed operator vehicles of any kind should never exceed 25 HP, This goes for motorcycles, hoverbikes, hoverboards, riding lawnmowers, and whatever else people come up with.
4. Gunships may never exceed 150 HP.
    * What is a Gunship? An armoured flying vehicle with the main function of engaging ground targets. These are generally operated by one or two people.
    * Dropships may have up to 250 HP. 
    * What is a Dropship you may ask? A flying vehicle with the main function of transporting combatants to an area. They are generally lightly armed, or have crewed weapons, rather than being a one man killing machine.
5. Automatic interception systems on vehicles are ONLY allowed for fleetships. This is due to fleetships presenting an extremely large, obvious target, that utilize little to no cover, with limited mobility. They are naval vessels, not agile jet fighters.            
    * Automated interception systems on fleetships must be reasonable. We will determine what is reasonable.
            
# IV. Notes

## Rule Violations & Bans: 
1. There is now a three strike policy in place regarding violating the rules.
    * On your first offense, you will get a warning, then you will get locked in placed and/or glassed to make you pay attention, and then administrative action will be taken.
    * Afterwards, No warning will be given. 
    * Ban lengths - Offenses will be considered consecutive within the timespan of a week after expiration, If you're being an obnoxious little jackass about it, it will be a month.
    * This means if you get banned for 72 hours, and then come back six days later to act like a shithead again, your next ban will be for a week.
    * The first offense will be met with a 24 hour ban.
    * The second offense will be 72.
    * The third offense will be for a week.
    * Any offenses after this will be considered third offense.
    * You will not be PERMANENTLY banned for anything other than Sim Crashing, Graphics Crashing, Abuse Reporting, Intentionally disrupting sim performance (ie turning off rezzing or physics), or consistent violations of sim rules beyond three strikes.
    * If you were banned for any reason a notecard will have been made to log the ban. If a ban report cannot be found, the ban will be lifted after a period of 24 hours, to allow for any banning admin to explain it and provide said notecard.
    * If you feel you have been unjustly banned, and aren't just being a little smartass about it, Contact Hadet Sonnenkern, Dread Hudson, JakobBischerk, Saerasong, or Riki Dumont. Punishment will be issued to the appropriate parties. This includes you.
    
## Administrative Staff:

* OIC
* Command Staff
* Land Group Moderators.

* While we may not ban you if you're doing something exceptionally stupid we may remove your ability to rez objects for some time and/or lock you in place until you have cooled down.

## HOW TO RAYCAST: 

THIS IS A BASIC EXPLOSIVE
```
list rc=llCastRay(llGetPos(),llDetectedPos(0),[RC_REJECT_TYPES,RC_REJECT_PHYSICAL|RC_REJECT_AGENTS]);
```
- This fires a raycast from the objects position, to the detected position. It also ignores PHYSICAL and AGENT (Avatars).
```
if(llList2Integer(rc,-1)<1) 
```
- This checks if the raycast returns no hits. Because we are ignoring agents and physical, if there is not a SOLID, PASSIVE (Ie Environments) object in the way, you're all good
    
## HOW TO PARTIAL DAMAGE EXPLOSIVES

Base distance of 10 Meters. 5 Meters or less is 100 damage, over is falloff to 0.
```   
    if(llDetectedType(i)&0x1)
    {
        integer bit=llGetAgentInfo(tar);//Are they sitting? @ line 32
        vector pos=llDetectedPos(i);
        integer dmg=100;
        list rc=llCastRay(llGetPos()+<0,0,.3>,pos+<0,0,.3>,[RC_REJECT_TYPES,RC_REJECT_PHYSICAL|RC_REJECT_AGENTS]);
        float dist=llVecDist(llGetPos(),pos);
        if(llList2Integer(rc,-1)<1)
        {
            if(dist<=5)dmg=100;
            else dmg=100-llRound(((dist-5)*20));
        }
        else dmg=0;
        if(dmg>0)
        {
            key root=llList2Key(llGetObjectDetails(tar,[OBJECT_ROOT]),0);
            list d=llGetObjectDetails(root,[OBJECT_PHANTOM]);
            integer vd=llList2Integer(d,0);
            if(dmg>0&&vd==0)
            {
                integer pass=((integer)("0x" + llGetSubString(tar, 0, 3)) << 16) | dmg;
                llRezObject("[Chaos] Seeking/Scaling Kill Prim",llGetPos(),ZERO_VECTOR,ZERO_ROTATION,pass);
            }
        }
    }
```
