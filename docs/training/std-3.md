# Veteran Promotion Requirements

At this point, the trainee should have already finished their initial renegade training (sections 1-3 can be found here) and one of the divisional trainings (sections 4-5 can be found here

They also should:
+ Be an active member in the group for at LEAST 14 days after attaining the rank of Renegade
+ Be recommended for promotion by at least 2 active members of Marauder rank or higher.

After the above requirements have been met, the trainee should be promoted to Veteran. THEN they may continue their training below.

Keep in mind, they will have to complete BOTH sections 4 AND 5 to be eligible for promotion to Marauder but get them through sections 6 and 7 first if possible.

### PARAPHRASE / TEACH THE FOLLOWING!
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

#### Flamer
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Layer 1
+ Fires FIRE. 3 modes
  + '1' to increase pressure, '2' to decrease
    + Max - Flames bounce once
    + Med - Flames do not bounce
    + Min - Sprays Fuel that can be lit with other fire sources
      + Flamer, Inferno grenade, plasma, backblast from planes/assault pack
+ FIRE DOES AT!

#### Flamer Fuel Pack (Marauder rank - Ferrum)
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Increase fuel capacity (from 25 to 100 units)
+ Reload turns into recharge over time
+ May reload below 25 units of fuel (2.5 seconds)
+ Changing to flamer from other weapon initiates reload animation

#### Bolter
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Layer 1
+ Full-auto explosive rounds.
  + Explosion deals partial damage in 2m radius
  + 24 bolts/mag,
  + 40-round belt available as unlockable wargear.
    + Switch magazine types with /1 mag
  + Belt lowers fire rate, accuracy, and has a chance to jam.

The bolter is a potent suppression weapon that can also act as a force multiplier when we have the high ground. The bullets will detonate as small explosions, so if you haven't worked it out, shooting down at people allows you to levy the explosive ammunition to its full potential and aim at the ground of where someone is going to better secure a kill.


#### Bolt Pistol
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Is exactly what you think it is.
+ Semi-auto, 8 rounds in the magazine.
+ Exploding rounds means higher position relative to a target = better.
+ Optional 16-round belt mags are available as unlockable wargear.
  + Switch magazine types with /1 mag


#### Heavy Bolter
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Layer 1
+ Is essentially a heavy stubber with bolter rounds and a 60 round mag.
+ Exploding rounds means higher position relative to a target = better.
+ Can deploy for more accuracy (press C) on almost any cover from around your knees to your nips in height.


#### MeltaGun
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Layer 3
+ Deals AT and LL damage in a short-range line directly in front of you
  + Effective range of 15 meters
  + Damage grows and shrinks depending on how close you are to the target
+ Instead of ammunition it uses a pool of 30 units of energy, which recharges when not in use.

Meltas do not like armor. If you get close enough to anything, the melta will kill it. A meltagun in the middle of high-HP enemy deployables with an inferno already on their teleporter can really fuck with their front line.

As above, unless you have someone doing a good job stopping aircraft, don't just assume you don't have a responsibility to switch weapons to give the group a better edge. Stay aware of the situation, with the meltagun especially.

#### Catachan Pattern Grenade Launcher
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Layer 3
+ Fires six grenades per mag in a parabolic arc.
+ Controls:
  + Left click to fire.
  + ‘R’ to reload or confirm cycled grenade type. Reloads one grenade at a time, fire at any point to cancel the reload.
  + ‘1’ to cycle grenade type forward
  + '2' to cycle grenade type backward

Our grenade launcher is very similar to the mortar, though it has slightly more utility. A more skill based weapon, the launcher has six shells to fire that must each be manually loaded, but this means that each shell can be fired after a reload of a single shell has finished. Much like the mortar, each round fulfills a similar purpose.

#### Chainsword
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ 5m range
+ Hold C to grind (Gradual AT delivery and partial avatar damage)
+ Tap/let go of C to do instant kill (avatars)
+ Collects skulls.

#### Battle Standard
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ 5m range melee.
+ Can be planted with Q.
+ Hands applications to people that click it.

### PARAPHRASE / TEACH THE FOLLOWING:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

#### Leman Russ Main Battle Tank
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

The Leman Russ is a bull compared to the Chimera. It is slimmer, taller, heavier, slower, and has more firepower. It can act both as a base of fire by getting to a good position and suppressing or killing through volume of fire, or can completely disrupt a line by breaking into a formation and being a distraction and killing what it has to. Explain the Leman Russ is one of the heaviest tanks in the SLMC, meaning it can ram into other tanks and shock the enemy or disrupt their ability to attack effectively

Practice driving the Leman Russ around the sim. Explain that tanks are a fundamental part of heavy support. As a veteran, they are the first ones expected to respond to a call for a tank, and are usually expected to deploy the Leman Russ. Reiterate once again the importance of deploying with the correct HP type (LBA or LBA Lite) in the midst of combat.

##### Controls:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ /1hp Sets how much health of what type you’ll deploy with
+ /1 wep sets which hull mount you'll deploy with
  + Hull mounted weapons:
    + Heavy Bolter: Exactly like the one on the Chimera
    + Heavy Flamer: Ditto
    + Lascannon (leave this blank until we know what it actually does):
    + Autocannon (leave this blank until we know what it actually does):
    + Whatever the hell else Dread tech-heresies in here:


+ Left click to fire coaxial heavy stubber
+ ‘E’ to fire hull-mounted heavy bolter
+ ‘C’ to fire vanquisher cannon
+ ‘1’ to select cannon shell
  + HE operates similarly to a fragmentation rocket, and is used for anti-infantry.
  + AP delivers 50 AT to whatever it strikes, and 10 AT on a splash.

Have them get used to the controls and do a skirmish. Make sure they understand that they should prioritizing facing towards anything they want to kill so all three weapons are able to fire and that their only LBA munition is the main cannon and heavy flamer (if equipped).

## S6, III. Ferrum/Heavy Support Veteran Weapons
---

### PARAPHRASE / TEACH THE FOLLOWING:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

Nothing here! Our training has been gutted! My line has ended!

Encourage trainee to experiment with different weapons, loadouts, and styles of fighting: for instance, despite the suppression applications of the bolter and grenade launcher, both can very effectively push a line, especially when used from elevated positions. The meltagun in particular is great in close quarters. Just re-iterate Ferrum will prioritize securing positions, but they shouldn't be afraid of aggression.

---
## S6, IV. Ferrum/Heavy Support Veteran Vehicles
---

#### Wyvern Suppression Tank (Unreleased, get Sam or Dread to demonstrate functions)
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Great for area denial.
+ Can move while shelling a marked location.

##### Controls:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ WASD to move
+ E to fire hull-mounted heavy bolter
+ Left click to fire main turret. Uses mortar mouselook firing
+ F to fire main turret at locked coords
+ R to reload
+ 2 to switch ammo types
  + Stormshard: Airbursts and releases essentially a shotgun blast.
  + Stormshard HE: It’s an HE mortar shell.
+ 1 in alt-cam to lock coords
+ C+left click while in mouselook also locks coords
+ C clears the current coordinates

Based closely on the Hydra design, the Wyvern exchanges the Hydras anti-aircraft cannons for a pair of twin-linked Stormshard Mortars. The Mortars unleash a torrent of airbursting shrapnel shells which shred enemy infantry.

Wyvern (when it's released) is a burst-fire tank mortar of death. Use it to shell entrenched positions or lines of advancing forces, but otherwise treat it like a Hydra, except you can use it at high positions. Be mindful that if something is above you, hey guess what you're useless.

Aside from the HE shells, you have stormshards (airburst shotgun shells), airburst (scatter MIRV shells), razorwire shells, inferno shells, and krak shells.


#### The Vulture Gunship
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Excellent for providing short-lived strafing/saturation fire on ground troops and vehicles.
+ LBA light ONLY, will die very quickly unless you are careful and skillful.
+ Has an accurate hitbox around the entirety of the vehicle. Be mindful where your wings are!
+ Requires a gunner to use the nose weapon.
+ Can roadkill infantry.

##### Controls:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ W to move forward
+ S to reverse
+ A to strafe left
+ D to strafe right
+ E to ascend
+ C to descend
+ Mouse1 to fire inner hardpoints
+ F to fire outer hardpoints
+ R to reload flares and hardpoints
+ 2 to fire flares
+ AS GUNNER:
    + Mouse1 to fire nose weapon. Note that you have a limited turret traverse much like the hull mounted weapons on our armored ground vehicles.

##### Current hardpoints:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Rocket Pods:
  + 19 rounds of mini-frag rockets. 38 total.
  + Deals 3 AT on direct hit to armor.


+ Hunter-Killer Missiles:
  + Ground vehicle-seeking rockets that deal 40 AT on direct hit to armor, 10 on a splash.

##### Current nose weapons:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Heavy bolter. Same as the one on the chimera, but with a different turret traverse limit.

Have them practice flying around the sim. Note that due to their fragility, it is good practice to not stay exposed for too long. Line up a strafing run or a target, ascend from cover, strike on the move whilst popping flares on the way, and descend behind cover. Holding E whilst pointing the nose of the craft diagonally downwards and flying forwards will prevent them from slamming into the ground while doing a strafing run. Note that it is best used in urban builds with tall buildings along relatively wide roads, or wherever else has decent air cover

### PARAPHRASE / TEACH THE FOLLOWING:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

#### Dual Mortis Autopistols
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Layer 2
+ The Mortis-pattern autopistol… but two of them.
+ Double the fun means around twice the reload time
+ Ideal for grav chute deployment
+ /1 mode to change from simultaneous fire to manual fire
  + While in this mode, mouse1 fires right-hand weapon, C fires left-hand weapon.

---
## S6, VI. Mortis/Fast Attack Veteran Vehicles
---

#### The Valkyrie
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ 150 hp, LBA lite only
+ Holds up to 6 passengers, 2 door gunners, and the pilot
+ Multilas shreds pretty decently. Don’t rely on it in lag.
+ 32 mini frag rockets

##### Controls:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ WASD for Forward, strafe left, reverse, strafe right
+ E, C for ascend/descend
+ Mouse1 to fire multilas
+ F to fire rockets
+ 2 to fire flares
+ R to reload everything

Additional Valkyrie-related training:
+ fly it without killing yourself and you'll get an A+
+ I don't know have them fly people around and deploy them over certain points. use the markers for the deployment/gravchute training. I don't know ~~this plane sucks~~ we literally never use it.

Note from Sam: That's **your** problem. The plane is amazing but needs to have the lascannon gesture changed to something we can access again.


#### The Helltalon
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

Note from Sam: This is **not** to be used in an anti tank capacity until its munitions have been updated. **Do not** use the cluster munitions **at all**.

##### Controls
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

## S6, VII. OPTIONAL - Advanced Movement Obstacle Course
---

+ While it's a way of further teaching about prim-jumping as legit movement, it is in no way testing superiority in SL movement. IT IS THE ULTIMATE TEST OF PATIENCE.

+ No time limit, no use of anything besides avatar movement controls. List of NO: No AV flying, no use of the HUD (Placing barricades, breaches etc), no sit hacking, no spacebarring.

+ Start home at green line, 2 checkpoints in Green Boxes halfway in to set home. For them to complete the course they must land on the red prim at the very end, and must have jumped through the course.

### Pre-deployment commands
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ /1 hp: Choose between LBAL and LBA (LBA is default)
+ /1 rm: Toggle between global rezzing and local rezzing (Defaults at 50m)
+ /1 h:##: Sets deployment height
+ /1 tur or /1 turret: Choose type of turret (Las-Battery and missile pod) More info below

### Deployment
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Use your Rapid Deployment key that comes standard with other vehicles and accept the Permission Request when prompted.

### HUD
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Each Fleetship comes with its own HUD that will emerge when you have accepted the controls.
+ The HUD will handle things such as Munition selection for ground bombardment cannons and Modular turret selection.

### Combat Controls
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Fleet ships will have multiple systems that can be fired independently and simultaneously with each other.
+ They're controlled after selection with your mouse, and basic gestures depending on the system, as well as the HUD.
+ For Iconoclast:
  + Use '1' to toggle through type of weapon system
  + Use '2' to toggle ammunition type if available.

### Iconoclast Weapon Modules
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Mouse 1 trigger
  + Bombardment cannon
    + High Explosive Shell (50AT)
    + Ignition Shell (25AT and ignites virusbomb gas from Naglfar)


+ Turret
  + Las-Battery (Raycast 15AT)
  + Missile pod (15AT LBA or 25AT Normal - Dumb Fire and locks on later if within vicinity)


+ Side Bolters
  + Manually aim and fire, or use "Space" to toggle interception field

Some Fleetships will have Torpedoes or Missile systems which will fire on the "f" gesture included in the basic gesture box.

These are designed for Massive damage during ship-to-ship engagements.

### Combat Box Formation
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ A Primer on the concept and history of combat box formations can be seen here:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_box

+ The Idea of a box Formation is to create a Three Dimensional Arrangement of ships in a box of overlapping fields of fire to minimize the need for a fighter escort.
+ It enables the Fleet to act with minimal fighter support and frees up the Fighters and Bombers to do their intended job instead of babysitting the fleet.
+ However Combat Boxes can also be established using multiple aircraft and a single Fleet ship.
+ Ideally we'd want to have several Escort class ships and a Cruiser or Capital Ship to Increase our dominance of the sky.

  + Battlefleet and ALL courses must be completed
  + Be active in the group for at least 90 days after attaining the rank of Veteran
  + Be recommended by AT LEAST 2 active members of Chosen rank or higher
  + At least two of the following must be true:
    + Completed, shadowed, or otherwise supervised/vouched for cultist training where the Veteran primarily lead the training
    + Completed, shadowed, or otherwise supervised/vouched for STD where the veteran primarily led the training
    + Led at least two major(6+ enemies) raids or defenses. Chosen+ must vouch for it
    + Contribution to Mechanicus Projects- either participation in items currently in testing, in the armory, or a substantial part of the current sim build. OVERLORD APPROVAL REQUIRED!
  + The group is to have a need for one- for instance, we must have 2-3 active Renegades/Veterans to justify a Marauder promotion. The group grows bottom-up.

+ Once the trainee has been promoted to Marauder, they may continue the optional training below to familiarize themselves with the new weapons, gear, and vehicles.

### Plasma Pistol
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Layer 2
+ Does not use ammo, instead generates 15 "heat" per shot
+ Overheating will teach the unwise lessons of pain.
  + Over 70 heat will deal 2% damage per tick to the wielder
  + Over 100 heat will **double** the current heat, initiate an immediate reload, and deal 5% damage per tick until heat returns to 0


+ Semi-automatic
+ 5 AT on direct hit, 3 AT and LL splash damage, and damage over time from plasma burst.


### Raptor Powersword
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Layer 2
+ Mostly a neat shiny thing that you can have in place of the chainsword.
+ Doesn’t do AT to deployables.
+ Delivers 5 AT to vehicles or other seated avatars.

### Discipline Baton
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Layer 2
+ A(n) ~~worthless~~ **amazing** melee weapon that doesn't collect skulls and does partial damage by default
+ Smack ~~people~~ **CULTISTS AREN'T PEOPLE** with it and get blackscreened when they get pissed at you.
+ 10/10

### Plasma Gun
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Layer 1
+ A decent mid-range skillshot weapon
+ High AT output
+ Has heat in place of ammo; the more you shoot, the faster heat builds up
+ Upon overheating, it automatically vents heat and damages the wielder until fully cooled.
+ Can vent heat early by pressing R
+ Fires on mouse up instead of mouse down
  + Left click can be charged in order to deal more AT and have a wider AoE. Doing so generates more heat than normal.

 Use it to burn out with indirect fire or defend a position by making paths to it unpassable. Let it charge to 100 ammo and burst fire and wave your cursor around whilst pointing in the air. Create impassable walls of fire. If the fighting is especially chaotic, go to full fuel pressure and do the same thing, except now even you don't know where the fire will go- it may even bounce back. Be responsible and don't spray fuel everywhere unless you intend to ignite it. Remember to also have a range option in case you're caught without fuel in the tank, because it can and will run out and you'll be sitting on your hands in a panic.

Congrats, dickhead, you're done.

No, really. Get the fuck out of my office.
