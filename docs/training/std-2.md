# Prologue: Veteran Training Requirements

After the first two parts of renegade training (Sections 1-2) have been completed, please continue on with Imperfectus Vehicle Training (Section 3) which can be found below.

Once the first three sections are completed ENTIRETY, Renegades must choose role-specific training to undergo, either Heavy Support (Section 4) or Fast Attack (Section 5)

Consideration for promotion to VETERAN includes:
+ completion of training sections 1-3
+ completion of one role-specific training section mentioned above
+ 14 days participation
+ recommendation of 2 members at rank Marauder or above.

After promotion to Veteran, they must complete advanced Veteran training FIRST (Sections 6 and 7), as well as the remaining role-specific in order to be considered for Marauder.
+ This INCLUDES going back to EITHER Section 4 or 5 depending on their prior selection (for example, if you went Heavy Support, you must get the Fast Attack training before moving on to the Veteran Fast Attack training.)

## Table of Contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

I. Vehicle Etiquette

II. Tank Training - The Chimera

III. Plane Training - The Avenger

Explain that the next section will be dedicated to training with all of the vehicles accessible to all Renegade group members. (The Chimera & The Avenger) Make sure the Renegade has a functional “~” key that will deploy their vehicle or that they rebind the gesture if they do not.

All Training to be done on ground level of sim. This is so they get used to how the vehicles behave and get some practice on not flipping over and taking cover. Always double check to make sure their vehicles are up to date!]

## S3, I. Vehicle Etiquette

+ Deploy armored vehicles ONLY when instructed to by the OIC
  + We don’t just jump into tanks and planes because we feel like it or if we’re bored with the raid


+ Take the initiative and VOLUNTEER to deploy vehicles when there is a need for one!
 + The worst an OIC will do is say "No."


+ If you are out in/on a vehicle and you are told to get off you GET THE FUCK OFF AND YOU GET THE FUCK OFF NOW.
  + Do it now, ask questions AFTER the raid. Period.


+ RLV recommended. Quickly deploys vehicles. [Explain how to set up RLV and instruct Renegade to relog.]

## S3, II. Tank Training - The Chimera

### The Chimera is a big dumb tank for big dumb bois.
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Each tank has a “hull” and a “turret” section. All tanks in the group will be deployed using one turret and one hull.

### Modes & Basic Controls
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Modes (/1 hp)
  + LBAL 100 and 200hp
    + LBA Light mode. LBA Light takes damage from bullets and things that hit it hard.

  + LBA 100 and 200hp
    + Full LBA mode, damage only from LBA weapons.
    + Like deployables, damage is near-instant.


+ Note that the Chimera will DEFAULT to LBA. Some sims only allow LBA-Light
 + Always check with the OIC.

### Rezzing the Sitbase
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Rez sitbase with /1 rez ('~' with Chaos gesture).
+ /1 hp to set HP and know which one to choose appropriately
 + Match up to enemy tank's HP, or as instructed by OIC.
   + 200 is usually fine though.

### Controls
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ W: Forward
+ S: Backwards
+ A: Turn left
+ D: Turn right
+ Mouse1: Fire turret
+ E: Fire hull mount

### Hull mounts (/1 wep)
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Hull mounts can only fire in a limited angle in front of the vehicle, but are unconstrained vertically.

+ You may fire the turret and a hull mount at the same time. A hull mount will continue firing even if your camera rotates past its arc limit, allowing you to lay down 2 lanes of fire in radically different directions.

+ The currently available hull mounts are:
 + Heavy bolter: Exactly what it says on the tin. Performs like an infantry-carried, constantly-deployed heavy bolter with infinite ammo.

 + Heavy Flamer: Like a flamethrower that shoots further. Deals 1 LBA per shot, fire pools deal 1 LBA per second. The weapon of choice for armor engagements or close-range suppression.

### Deployment
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Passenger Sit prim on the back of the tank.
+ When deploying passengers:
  + COMMUNICATE to your passengers that you are deploying them or that they are to deploy on your mark.
   + You are the driver, it's your call


+ Make sure area is clear of hostiles so passengers may deploy safely to objectives.
 + Turn the back of tank AWAY from oncoming fire.
   + Use the Chimera as a temporary shield for infantry


+ DO NOT back up into an area where you just deployed troops or you might run them over.
 + Chimera can deal with infantry, but if there is enemy tank, call for backup (or switch to the autocannon if you are good enough.) DO NOT directly engage enemy tank unless necessary. You're a troop transport, NOT a main battle tank (MBT).

 + Friendlies can now ride in the chimera’s new gunner seats. Look for sitprims with translucent white bounding boxes. Militia and cultists can always ride, but other groups will have to be authed with the /1 auth:GROUPSUUIDGOESHERE command. Accept the takecontrols request as well as the temp attach for the hull gun in order to use it.

 + Stick around the spawn for at least 20 seconds if not under fire to collect passengers/gunners. Ask for gunners first as they have greater visibility/versatility. YOU ARE ALWAYS MORE EFFECTIVE AS A TEAM.

+ AS INFANTRY PASSENGERS, you are allowed to shoot out from your passenger positions to assist in clearing areas and objectives. Do not use raycast weapons to fire out of the chimera, as you will hit the driver.

### Movement
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Drive around base to get used to the movement. Chimera can easily climb up steep slopes. It has sensitive turning, however, and will easily tip over like a turtle.
+ Give them tips on more delicate areas (eg. steep hills, trench lines, places where they can easily get stuck.)
+ Speeds up over time with REAL MOMENTUM! Make sure they are used to navigating over weirdly shaped hills and obstacles so that they get an idea with how the chimera reacts climbing and descending obstacles.
+ Demonstrate (or at least explain) the Chimera's amphibious ability, just drive into some water.
 + If an EM is on, you can ask for the water level to be raised temporarily.


+ Keep tank moving, avoiding constant streams of fire.
 + Use cover much like infantry movement.
   + You can squish enemies (and friendlies) with front area of tank.

### Repairs
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Tanks can be repaired by Mechanicus Techaxe and general repair tool. If repair is possible, they should seek out cover and not move during repairs; moving can kill the repairman.
+ The rear of the Chimera is safest area to begin repairs.
 + Demonstrate this by getting behind them and asking them to move backwards. Do the same going forwards.
 + The rear of the Chimera generally is not lethal to collide into because people come out of it when it is being used as a transport.

+ If your tank is flipped somehow and unable to move, you may, if possible:
 + Request infantry to help flip you by rezzing deployables beneath you (barricades and tank traps work best).
 + Request other tanks to help flip you by physically pushing your vehicle.
 + Attempt to rez your own deployable under your tank to flip yourself back up
   + this is the most difficult method, remove the deployable once successful


+ Teleport home

+ DO NOT RE-REZ YOUR VEHICLE! DIE! SERIOUSLY!
 + this is shitty to do and bad form


+ TIME FOR DEATH!? Here are some things you MAY do if you are flipped and cannot right yourself:
 + Continue engaging opposition until death.
   + (have them practice firing while flipped, controls are reversed)

 + Teleport home.
 + Manually detonate using the cultist bomb belt ('P' key.), because why not. (Note: may not work. Teleport home after doing so as you are dead inside the vehicle)

### Turrets
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Autocannon Turret
 + Fires at a decent ROF with two round types, HE and AP.
   + HE has a wider explosion radius, ideal for infantry.
   + AP deals 5 AT per shot, 4 on a splash.
   + HE deals 3 AT on either a direct hit or splash.
   + Rounds have a chance to ignite scripted objects.
 + Switch rounds with "1" key.
 + Decent for fighting light vehicles if you can take advantage of the Chimera's speed, but generally not a great anti-infantry choice.
 + Ammo type is NOT saved on death.


+ Bolter Turret
 + A rapid-fire twin-linked heavy bolter.
 + Acts like the hull-mounted bolter, except it fires in every direction and fires two rounds per mouse-click.
 + Has a reload feature:
   + You are encouraged to fire in quick bursts rather than engage in prolonged suppression, otherwise, you will be unable to fire and will have to await the turret to cycle between magazines.
 + No AT, only explosions.
 + Decent for quick bursts of suppression or can simply act as a bullet hose tank.
 + HIGHEST DAMAGE OUTPUT IN THE ARMORY for non-LBA armor.


+ Multi-Las Turret
 + Fires laser beams very quickly.
 + It is a raycast weapon, but should still deal AT damage
   + But NOT LBA damage!!!!
 + Useful for pinpoint shooting if you're a good shot on the move, and fires the shots rather rapidly.
 + Unlike Heavy Bolter, no reloading.
 + Has a lot of spread if you don’t control yourself.

### Further Training
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Do a few target practice runs with the tank, get creative with it to get them going in regards to having to move efficiently and fire at targets (why not both simultaneously,) and be sure to tell them they can look behind them and fire the turret AND fire the heavy bolter in front of them.

+ Demonstrate common ways to engage armor- IE, ram the other tank from its side while firing all weapons, duck in and out of cover, etc.

+ OPTIONAL: TANK SKIRMISH! First to 5 kills. Use if Renegade needs more practice.

+ Remember, Chimera can suppress, fight, transport, and acts as distraction mobile.

+ Hold C or another base control input while firing any vehicle weapon to fire faster because SL is fucking dumb.

## S3, III. Tank Training - The Hydra

+ Mobile anti-aircraft platform.
+ Aim main turret above chassis line to fire.
+ Flak is NOT group-safe. Be mindful where you aim.
+ Flak rounds operate as HE rounds on contact. Manipulate your chassis angle for additional anti-infantry capabilities.

### Controls
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ W: Forward
+ A: Turn left
+ S: Reverse
+ D: Turn right
+ Mouse1: Fire turret
+ E: Fire Hull mount

### Training
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ The Hydra Flak Tank specializes in ground to air combat. It will fill the skies with highly explosive flak to take down both armoured and unarmoured flying vehicles. It is NOT group safe, so be mindful when firing into the skies, make sure there are no friendly air unit engaging enemy air vehicles before unloading payload.

+ The chassis is exactly that of the Chimera, so it drives the same way, front heavy bolters included for defense should ground units attempt to engage you. The bolter is defensive, so stay behind something and make sure your front is facing the vector you are most likely to get shot at from.

+ It can be also be used against ground infantry (acts as explosive rounds rather than flak below certain height ceiling). However, the Hydra cannot fire below its chassis horizon, so be mindful of your angle of elevation to ensure continuous delivery of flak/explosive barrage. That means the Hydra is best used at low elevations, higher ground will gimp its horizon.

## S3, IV. Plane Training - The Avenger

+ Flying is HARD. [Say this.]
 + Flying well is HARDER.
 + Zalera’s dick is the HARDEST


+ Flight in the SLMC requires good framerates, meaning you need a decent computer, to be on a good sim, and to roll lucky with Linden Lab that day.

### Uses/Roles
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ It is not a dogfighting plane, it is to be used for anti-fleetship, anti-tank, anti-deployable, and anti-infantry use
+ Use the Avenger as a reaction to enemy escalation, not as an escalation in of itself.
 + For example, is a fleetship deployed? React w/ Avenger.


+ Swift heavy-hitting strike fighter, or ground attack fighter.
+ Can function as a dive bomber or precision bomber.
+ Armed with an Avenger Bolt Cannon, missile pods, multiple underwing bombs, and a rear-facing stubber emplacement.
+ The avenger is meant to be used by a pilot and a co-pilot as a rear gunner.

### Basic Controls & Operations
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Attach the current version, then press ~
+ The Avenger moves with constant forward motion, so you must be ready to pull up or maneuver right away.
+ Holding W and S will activate the afterburner to reach a maximum speed for a short period of swift maneuvering.
 + Base speed: 46 meters per second


+ W: Accelerate up to 64m/s
+ S: Decelerate down to 32m/s
+ W+S: Boost to 100m/s
+ C: Hold to activate 'Head look' mode.
 + While in this mode the horizon of your craft is locked and you cannot use the bolt cannon.
 + A and D will yaw the craft left and right.
 + W and S will pitch the craft down and up


+ 1 will change your munition type.
 + see below for Munition Types


+ 2 will deploy countermeasure flares.
 + see below for Flare Controls


+ This is a mouselook fighter, which means that most, if not all, your maneuvering will be performed using the mouse to bank and turn.
+ Rolling is automatic, and will return the horizon of your craft to an upright position when moving parallel to the ground.

### Munitions
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ HE BOMB
 + Explosive that does partial damage at a distance
 + 15 AT on a DIRECT hit to armor or 100% LL damage on a DIRECT hit to an avatar.


+ Concussive Torpedo
 + Deals 40 AT, launches forward and inherits your vehicle’s momentum
 + HARD TO AIM.


+ Hunter-Killer Missile
 + 40 AT, 10 on splash
 + locks on to ground-based seated armor.


+ Flak Chaff Canister
 + Exactly what it says on the tin.
 + Drops a bomb directly beneath the craft which explodes within about a second
 + Deploys a cloud of chaff that blocks enemy flak munitions.


+ Countermeasure Flares.

+ Mouse 1 fires the Avenger Bolt Cannon
 + It's nasty. Real nasty.
 + Delivers 5 AT per hit to enemy armor.


+ F will fire the munition currently selected.
+ E will fire the micro rockets. 100% LL Damage in small explosive radius.

### Live Fire Test
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ YOU MUST ELIMINATE A LEMAN RUSS 5 TIMES AT 400 HP EACH. YOU WILL FAIL THE TEST IF THE FOLLOWING HAPPENS.
 + You obviously lose control 3 times
   + For instance, if you get stuck in an obstacle or start flipping/doing doughnuts.
 + You give up.


+ If they fail, it's up to you as to their punishment.
 + Recommended to make them restart the test from the beginning, or simply wait until the next day.


+ Bonus points if they use the concussive torpedo effectively.
+ Suggestion
 + Have them hit the tank 2 or 3 times with the HE bombs, Bolt Cannon, Hunter-Killer, and Conc Torp.
    Mastering your vehicle is the key to success, and as such, you must know how to use your munitions effectively.


+ OPTIONAL: Create your own knowledge checkpoint like the one from S2, III, P7. For instance, perhaps challenge them to fight a Chimera on foot? Kill a fleetship with the Avenger? Build on the knowledge of before and what the Renegade has struggled on.


## CHECKPOINT

- This concludes the Renegade Vehicle Training. The recruit must now chose a division below (Section 4 for Ferrum/Heavy Support, or Section 5 for Mortis/Fast Attack) And complete it in its entirety.

- At this time the recruit is only required to complete ONE of these training sections but if you both chose, you can do both now and save time later.


---
# Section 4: Ferrum/Heavy Support Training
---

## Table of Contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

I. Ferrum Orientation

II. Ferrum Infantry Equipment and Tactics

## S4, I. Ferrum Orientation

### Read the following:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Ferrum and the Heavy Support Doctrine relies on heavy vehicles, explosives, and suppressing fire to maintain pressure and secure positions. Acting in the Heavy Support role is not just about your gear, it is about the mentality you’re in when you enter the fight.

## S4, II. Ferrum Infantry Equipment and Tactics

### Basic hud utilities, equipment, and additional weapons
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Shotgun Inferno Mode
 + The Shotgun's inferno mode fires a fireball in a parabolic arc that deals 3 AT for the initial shot, and around 18 AT from the fire pool left behind.


+ Heavy Stubber
 + High rpm, varying ammo capacity (/1mag). [120 Drum or 60 Box]
 + Higher ammo capacity, lower accuracy, longer reload time.
 + Moving while firing decreases accuracy.
 + Entrenchment mode
   + Sit on sandbags or activate with 'C' on cover you can see over
   + Higher accuracy.
   + Deactivates when unsat, moving, or looking up or down too far.

### Re-iterate use of deployables in HUD
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Ferrum makes more use of deployables than Mortis.
+ Barricades, DADS, Barbwires, Sandbags, warp gates, mines, EVERYTHING in your HUD is to be used in full force when you're fortifying an area.
 + Use some areas on sim as examples. Make it clear that you don't need to be specifically defending objectives
 + Many sims have areas of high cover that allow us to fortify more easily and stage attacks.
 + BACK-UP WARP GATES! In the heavy support role, you are primarily responsible for keeping our soldiers in the fight. If nobody has a backup placed, it is YOUR JOB to ensure one is there. Call it out.

### Re-explain the Rocket Launcher and Repair tool
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Specifically, how ferrum is more easily able to seeker-rocket aircraft from the backline and how repairing deployables can be more useful than asking someone to replace them, or having them remember to replace them on death.
- Use a repair tool to assist Mechanicus when possible. Fix barricades, turrets, and generators. The turrets need someone there to reload them, so be a good boy.

### Explain that despite being in Ferrum, being flexible is paramount.
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ If we only have members of Ferrum on attack or defense, playing passively is not going to get us anywhere. Clear an area and put a warp gate behind cover, seek and destroy enemy artillery: do not get stuck in one way of fighting, just bear in mind that with our equipment you are predisposed to providing backline support, securing a position, and seeking to support a new one.

# Section 5: Mortis/Fast Attack Training
---
## Table of Contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

I. Mortis Orientation

II. Mortis Ground Equipment

+ Part 1. Mortis Guns

+ Part 2. The Assault Bike

III. Mortis Deployment Tactics

IV. The Hellblade

## S5, I. Mortis Orientation

### Read the following
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ The Mortis or Fast Attack doctrine emphasizes quickly taking positions and outmaneuvering a foe.
+ Assault Packs take ground, assault bikes are hard to shoot at and can kill tanks, and the hellblade is one of the most effective interceptors in the entire SLMC.

## S5, II. Mortis Ground Equipment

### S5, II, P1. Mortis Guns

#### Paraphrase/teach the following
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Mortis Pattern Autopistol
 + Make sure the trainee understands the spread of the weapon.
 + Has less ammo than Voss autopistol.
 + Is more accurate than Voss autopistol.
 + Has a higher firerate than Voss autopistol.


+ Accatran Flak Shotgun Munitions
 + This is an expansion to their shotgun training so not much needs to be explained
   + Better against air targets (low flying / slow aircraft, jet/jump packers.)
   + 15m height is where the flak activates


### S5, II, P2. The Assault Bike

#### Paraphrase/teach the following
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Assault Bike
 + Explain to them the difference between the armored and unarmored version of the bike and to not use the unarmored version.
 + After that explain all the different lances (Explain the ones that are currently out).
 + Finally explain the main tactics of using the bike for Interception, Distraction, and Spearheading.
 + Yell at Dread to update the Assault Bike. Do not stop yelling at him even if he gets mad and yells at you

#### Movement & Controls
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Attach and press ~ to deploy
+ Controls in or out mouselook
 + but you can only use the lance IN mouselook so that’s better


+ W: Forward
+ A: Turn left
+ D: Turn right
+ S: Back up
+ E: Holding while moving lifts the front tire off of the ground
 + Which is useful for getting over shit

#### Roles of the Assault Bike
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Interception
 + The bike as an interceptor is to stop enemy vehicles or fast moving targets from moving across the field any further than they are.


+ Distraction
 + The bike is a perfect distraction to infantry and vehicles to draw their fire so other group members can assist in taking down the enemy targets.


+ Spearhead
 + The bikes can punch into enemy fortifications and cause chaos inside their defenses, push through in order to intercept & distract the enemy defenses to have the rest of Mortis and Ferrum move in.

#### Weapons and Munitions
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Lances
 + Make sure your other weapons are put away (set 4)
 + Simply attach the lance, left click in mouselook to throw
 + Lance will “reload” after a few seconds


+ One-handed weapons
 + You are allowed to use ONE one-handed weapon on the assault bike.


+ Grenades and mines
 + You may toss grenades and mines while riding the assault bike.
   + Mines MUST be tossed, NOT placed!


+ NOTHING ELSE MAY BE USED WHILE RIDING THE ASSAULT BIKE. STOP ASKING.

#### Courses & Knowledge Check
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Bike VS DADS

    Have them drive around and use the lance on stationary D.A.D.S you put out.
    After lance practice have them then move to using Krak and Melta grenades

+ Bike VS Bike

    first do a few rounds with you as ground and have them both lance and grenade you.
    If they focus more on one, have them only use the other until they get use to it.
    Get them used to fast moving targets attacking them

+ Bike VS Tank

    Have another member of Chaos help you by hopping into a 200HP LBA Leman Russ.
    Have them use either grenades or their lance to take down the tank

## S5, III. Mortis Deployment Tactics

### Paraphrase the following
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Impress upon the Renegade the importance of Mortis opening a hole in a line. This means quickly advancing and using every tool at their disposal to open up an opportunity for everyone else to move forward.

+ This includes, when permitted, setting up FORWARD Warp Gates and COMMUNICATING with the rest of the group when the warp gate is ready to be used. When the gate is in a safe position, half the current raid/defense team entering an area can very quickly turn the tide of a fight.

+ Take the initiative. Can a bike, chimera, hellblade, or Avenger be used in this situation to even the odds? ASK TO USE IT! Do mines need to be cleared on an objective? Use krak grenades or krak rockets. Be the first one to solve a problem or suggest a solution.

## S5, IV. The Hellblade

### Pre-training
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Check that the trainee has the optimal FPS to partake in air combat.
 + An ideal FPS would be between 30 - 40. The higher the better.
 + To check FPS, use CTRL + SHIFT + 1


+ The hellblade does backblast damage so watch where you’re flying!
 + It also does damage to everyone if you hover over them at 7 meters or less.
   + Which is ~~funny sometimes~~ absolutely hilarious, every time.

### Basic Controls and Commands
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Attach and press ~ to deploy
 + Or /1 rez


+ /1 reset: Forces a script restart.
+ 1: Toggles between the three missile munition types.
+ 2: Fires flares! You have 4 flares before they have to reload.
+ F: If using a seeking missile, activates the detection sweep to lock on, and then fires once locked on. Otherwise, fires your munition.

### Movement
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Plane controls in mouselook
+ W moves forward
+ Control turning/pitching with mouse
 + It takes a lot of getting used to, spend as much time as they need on this part, have them follow you around the sim. Fly over, under, and around shit until they get the hang of it


+ W+S activates afterburners (boost)
 + Fly into the sim border with this to avoid getting hit by seekers ;^)
 + 8 second boost, 5 second recharge


+ The red square is where your pointed/facing so if you get turned around just find the square

### Munitions
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Shell Munitions
 + Hellblade Pulse
   + Basic ballistic munitions, for use against ground or armored targets.
   + Fire with left mouse click
   + You have unlimited ammo.


+ Missile Munitions
 + Frag Rocket
   + Air to Ground missiles, 10 meter radius, 10 AT
   + 4 rounds in the magazine.
  + Flakk Missile
   + Air to Air missiles, 25 AT Homing AAMS
   + Press F to activate, once you’re locked on press F again to fire.
   + Locked target will show in chat, if you accidentally lock onto one of us, hit R to reload. Always double check who you're locked on before you fire.
   + Cancel lock on by pressing F
   + 4 rounds in the magazine.
  + Concussive Torpedo
   + Air to Ground bomb, 75 AT, 10 Meters
   + 2 rounds in the magazine.

### Hellblade Duel
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Test them. Make sure they are comfortable with flying AND firing
 + Have them use all the munitions and make use of everything


+ Things to keep an eye on during the simulation
 + Did the trainee maintain movement?
 + Did the trainee make use of flak?


+ Once again. DO NOT BE LENIENT WITH THE TRAINEE. JUDGE THEM ON HOW THEY DESERVE TO BE JUDGED.

# CHECKPOINT
---

## End of All Renegade Training & Veteran Promotion Requirements
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ This concludes the Renegade Portion of Training; However, in order to be considered for promotion to Veteran, and to then proceed with the remainder of this training, the trainee must first:
 + Complete Sections 1 Through 3 of this training
 + Complete Sections 4 and/or 5 of this training
      + OR is only necessary for Veteran promotion
      + However keep in mind they WILL have to do BOTH to be promoted from Veteran to Marauder later on
 + Be an active member in the group for at LEAST 14 days after attaining the rank of Renegade
 + Be recommended for promotion by at least 2 active members of Marauder rank or higher.


+ After all of the above 4 requirements have been met, the Renegade may be promoted to Veteran and continue their training
