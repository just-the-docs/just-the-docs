### Introduction
This Document is to be used as reference material for all members of the
Chaos Indivsivm forces, a Warhammer 40K themed Second Life military group.
Within this Handbook you will find topics on history, lore, guidelines for behavior within the group, expectations and duties you are expected to perform whilst in the ranks of Chaos Indivisivm.


### Our History

Chaos traces its roots back to the aftermath of the Pan-Slavya coaltion, originally created as a mockery of the Ordo Imperialis. Where they had Order, We brought Chaos. While they were Imperial, we were Heretical.

This irked the furry menace to no end, and eventually efforts were exhausted and the forces of Chaos were put on ice.

After a short hiatus due to Chaos being taken in a poor light, the original Dominus, Dark Svenska, grew to have a taste for power. Dominus Dark Svenska recreated Chaos with the intent of conquest, as a legitimate military organization that would bring forth a new era of combat.

With the creation of the Iron Symphony & the Anvil Coalition, the Second Life Military Community faced a new threat; Alliances of power-hungry leaders who would not leave a game as just a game, those who wished to dictate how the community would exist for the unforeseeable future. These Alliances were spearheaded by the Ordo Imperialis & Vanguard, rival powers on the grid at the time, would attack dissenting groups internally and externally, without regards to what is and is not morally acceptable. The Second Life Military Community faced an era of political strife and drama, outweighing the fun of it. Thanks to these groups, their attacks led to a massive drop in SLMC activity.

During this Era, one banner was raised against these ideals; the banner of Decretum. The proud members of Chaos Decretum strode forth and fought against the political alliances and started a campaign to fuel the destruction of these groups.

Spiteful as it was, it was necessary at the time. However, a campaign of destruction often turns inwards once there are no remaining targets. In the midst of the campaign Chaos Decretum fell, but not after inflicting considerable damage to these factions.

Years after the death of Chaos Decretum, Chaos Eternus was born, forging a hellfire once more. Jaded from past failures, the Dominus' goal was to destroy what he could and to conquer - not through tactics, but sheer firepower. Such is how the notoriety of Chaos was earned. The grid was dragged through another campaign of hatred, one without an enemy clearly in sight.

Such is how Chaos Eternus was corrupted. It became polluted with those we once fought against and even the Dominus himself became guilty of furry sympathizing. The goal of the campaign was rendered out of reach and the will of Chaos was lost through the weakness that the furry scourge brought. Thus, Chaos Eternus died once again, to be reborn into a short lived revival of the Pan-Slavya Coalition, which then died due to the same faults of Eternus.

Upon said death, Dominus Svenska attempted to merge his forces with the Coercion Combine- an action which several of the command council vehemently protested against. Not heeding these warnings, it caused the ultimate split and the rejection of the Dominus from our ranks.

Sick of guiding a Rebel with such a lost cause, the Apostle Council created a new incarnation of Chaos. One for the new era of the grid, an era of rebuilding and growth, of new groups and new enemies. A new Chaos, separate from the follies of the past, Chaos Indivisvm, rose from the ashes.

Chaos Indivisvm had its follies: a tolerance of furries towards its beginning, a reliance on old technology, and a misplaced attachment on the mentalities of the past. The furries have since been cast out, old scripts and models replaced, our image and doctrine reforged.

And thus brings us to the present.. Years from founding; the group that wouldn't last a week.


### Our Goal

The Goal of Chaos Indivisvm, unlike its predecessors, is not to destroy the community, but rather to renew it. Whereas the Dominus found enemies at every side, we seek to find students. The old ways of combat have come and passed, the factions that plagued our community are dead, and now it is up to us to usher forth a new era in combat.

Seeing the flaws in the quest to destroy, we instead offer help in birthing new factions, and teaching others how to do what they strive to do in the right way. We have learned from the flaws of our predecessors that unwavering firepower comes at the price of fun. When you can lay waste to an entire battlefield in a single shot, combat loses its luster. It loses its enjoyment, and such a thing brings the death of the community.

Our goal, ultimately, is to spread endless war by facilitating the means to war, improving the community, technology, and activity within the SLMC, so that we will have everlasting battlefields to plunder and foes to slay.


### Expected Behaviour

#### Your Duty
Your duty as an soldier of Chaos Indivisvm is to combat the furry menace, to safeguard our land and to ensure the security of our group.

#### MUMBLE
MUMBLE ADDRESS IS : `ts.hadettheundying.com`

MUMBLE IS OUR PRIMARY LINE OF COMMUNICATION. STAYING IN MUMBLE DURING YOUR DOWNTIME IS THE BEST WAY TO KNOW WHEN WE ARE DOING STUFF!


#### Activity:
You are expected, upon joining, to take part in at least 3 raids ( attacks on other sims ) or defenses each week.

You are expected to be connected to Mumble when you are logged into SL, even if you're not actively participating in combat.
Activity is a very important aspect of your time in Chaos, affecting your eligibility for promotions, merits, and general standing within the group, as well as being the very lifeblood of our group. Without anybody participating, there is no group.

With this being said, we still do understand that real life does take priority, so if you have to take a break due to an unforeseen situation, let us know! Long periods of absence will be put into consideration. Established members of Chaos Indivisvm will be given the benefit of the doubt if they are not online for long periods of time, but if they are online often but not participating in Chaos activities they can/will be considered for administrative punishment as outlined in this handbook.

Cultists that are absent for long periods of time without notice will be considered for removal from the Cult Division on timed intervals in order to remove the dead flesh from the divisions recruit ranks. Chaos should not be wasting time on Cultists that do not actively seek advancement. Cultists who need to take a leave of absence due to real life or personal reasons should notify their Corruptor or an officer of the group. Cultists who need to take a leave of absence will be allowed to do so but may still be removed from the cult group depending on the length of the absence. However, they are welcome back to the cult group, and will be allowed to continue their training when they are able but may have to start from scratch depending on the length of the absence.


#### Common Activity

+ Idling:
Idling in the spawn area is not permitted, Please move to the Skirmish platform, VR or Build platform so that your avatar does not have to be rendered.

+ Combat:
In a combat situation, whether it be our territory being assaulted, or us raiding an opposing party, you are expected to participate.
Chaos Indivisvm is a COMBAT GROUP, and as such we practice it frequently. Failure to act when you could be changing the tide of a battle is highly frowned upon.
During combat operations, or situations of high alert, Notify the officer in command if you must depart or go AFK so that we can find someone to cover for you. If you fail to do so, you may leave a massive gap in our defenses that may turn the tide of any battle in the enemies favor.
Even when combat is not taking place, stay vigilant, enemies are afoot!

+ Recruitment:
Chaos Indivisvm is always open to receiving new members. If you have any friends that are interested in the SLMC, direct them our way. Applications are available in the teleport Hub, or via almost any member of Chaos.

During Recruitment Ops, a mobile application dispenser will most likely be utilized in the form of a banner.


+ Command of the Battlefield: (OIC, Officer In Command)
Command of any given situation is usually defaulted to the Overlord on duty. In the event that a ranking officer is not online, command is given to the highest ranking officer, or whoever takes charge in a situation. While you shouldn't step out of line when a chain of command is established, showing initiative in a time of need is never a bad thing.


+ Uniform Standards:
- You may customize your armor via tinting, However this must be approved by an Overlord.
- You may add decorations and 'Trophies' to your armor as long as they fit the 'Chaos' Theme.
- No form of furryshit including Nekos, Bronies and Japanese weeaboos.
- You must be wearing boots. Leg modifications must be approved by an Overlord.
- The Sororitas Armor by Heretech is allowed to be worn by female avatars, provided that an acceptable color is used.
( Direct link to this armor - https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stor ... ?id=161060)
-Though we'd much prefer you use the Female Vraksian Armor. (NO SPONGE!)

Your Uniform is to be worn at all times whilst on duty. Misrepresentation of Chaos through your laxness is not acceptable. Furry avatars are NEVER allowed. He who allows the furry to live shares the guilt of it's existence.

If you think your modification is extreme enough to warrant a second opinion, you probably have to ask an Overlord for approval.


+ Unlocking Gear:
Throughout your enlistment in Chaos, you will likely utilize different pieces of our armory. The higher the rank of the weapon, the higher the complexity, power, or utility.

Gear in the armory may be unlocked in several ways:
+ Promotions
+ Loyalty & Recommendation
+ Donation of 5k towards the sim tier, For a piece of gear of your choice. (Excluding vehicles, the plasma pistol, and god favor items)
+ Corruption unlocks (Corruption is earned over time in sim or while raiding, or through melee weapon kills, and can be used to unlock and upgrade some items)
+ Merit unlocks (Merits are awarded by command staff for displaying exceptional skill in combat during raids, or for achieving milestones at group meetings)


### Unacceptable Behaviour:

We're a fun bunch. Our mentality towards behavior and breaking the rules of others is anything that can reversed easily or fixed quickly can be forgiven as if it never happened. That said, there are some things we won't tolerate.

+ Sim Crashing: Intentionally crashing someone's sim or giving someone the means to do so isn't acceptable unless you are crashing our own sim or you have been asked to crash someone's sim by the sim owner / renter / etc. This is because crashing sims rolls sims back a few hours. If you do this, you can expect a warning and told not to do it again, followed by demotion or ejection.

+ Graphics Crashing: Zero tolerance. If you graphics crash someone, you are out.

+ Doxxing: Doxxing is revealing information about someone that is typically difficult to find, revealed in private, and/or the person in question doesn't want others to know about: specifically retaining to their REAL LIFE! Doxxing is not finding their furaffinity account. It's not OK to initiate autistic dox wars, don't do it. You will be ejected.

+ Leaking Equipment: Leaking someone else's hard work isn't cool. If you get handed something with perms, check with them before you distribute it. It's not your fault if it is given to you, but it is your fault to give it out again if it's privately distributed or sold. If it's the equipment of an opposing group that you don't like very much, that doesn't make giving it out okay by any means. This also extends to copybotting- if you don't have permission to do it, don't do it.
--Ripping textures is also generally not OK. If you own a modifiable object and want to mess with the cosmetics, ask the creator for the texture or permission to rip it if they have trouble finding it. Generally they will give it to you.

+ Causing Issues: Don't. Cause. Issues. Specifically internal ones. If someone, especially of rank, asks you to stop doing something, stop doing it. Things will be smoother for you and smoother for everyone else if you don't go out of your way to cause internal group drama and are open to cutting it out when called out on it.

+ Cheesing internal systems: Don't do this. We have systems in place to allow for corruption and god favour unlocks, which are meant to take time to get. If you find a loophole and abuse the hell out of it, you're stepping all over those who are earning corruption as intended, and cheapening the experience for all of us. These goalposts are there to encourage activity and to give you something to work towards.
If you find a bug, report it. Bug reports will never result in punishment, and may instead result in rewards for aiding in our development process.

+ Lying to Us: If you do something listed above, or something otherwise distasteful, do not lie about it. Any consequences given will be worse if you lie and may be mitigated if you are upfront and honest. We're smarter than you. We will find out eventually. All of us in this group has done something shitty or cringey on the internet, the difference is we don't lie about the shitty things we've done.

If someone doxes you, damages your hardware, etc. talk to us. It's OK to hit back, just make us aware of what happened so we can recommend a course of action. Once you are -in- this group, you are -in-, we will back you up; but we are NOT your personal army of autists.


+ Punishment:
Violating our handbook standards or sim rules may result in:
-Extremely tedious tasks.
-Suspension from Chaos Activity.
-Demotion one rank.
-Removal of God Favour or Corruption
-Sent to cultist trials and rank.
-Ejection from group.


+ Eradication:
Due to the filth that these two groups bring into our community, and the moral rot that previous incarnations of Chaos have suffered at their hands, there are two groups that are our sworn enemies, and any members are barred entry into our ranks they will receive NO mercy from the forces of Chaos.

Furries and Bronies.

Furries are NOT allowed in Chaos. Any caught spreading filth within our ranks will be purged with fire. If you find a Furry within our ranks, do not hesitate, report the scum to your nearest officer!

Bronies are even worse than Furries. If you find a Brony within the ranks, report them immediately. This plague must be stomped out before it has time to fester. Such a moral rot makes even the ruinous powers cringe in disgust.

That said, they also contribute to sim traffic. If you find one that is wandering the sim, let them tick up our numbers for a bit before murder.


### Rank Structure

The Ranking Structure is designed to ensure a military Standard. Respect for the ranking officers is expected, as those ranks have been earned through hard work & perseverance.

Ranks listed from lowest to highest:


+ [Militia] - [Reinforcement / Friends / House Plants]
- No authority.

Members of the militia may be in because they are under investigation of being a furry, a furry seeking to change their ways, someone from another group who likes fighting alongside us, or those who do not have the commitment to join our group in earnest. An extended time in militia may make someone eligible to skip their cult phase. Members of militia may donate for our gear. Militia is OPEN ENROLLMENT, if they don't do what you tell them to do or mouth off let someone higher know.


+ [Cultist] - [Recruit]
- No authority. Inductees into the group.

A cultist is a recruit that seeks to prove themselves worthy of becoming part of Chaos. They are taught basic information and combat maneuvers, and honed until they can hold their own in the field of battle.


+ [Renegade] - [Enlisted]
- Authority over cultists and militia.

The first, enlisted rank in Chaos. The first tier of personnel. Those who have proved themselves to be more than fodder and have been inducted into the group. The brunt of our forces, without which we have nothing.


+ [Veteran] - [Enlisted+]
- Authority over renegades, cultists, and militia. May lead small raids.

The second enlisted rank in Chaos. Veterans have either proven their mettle in combat to be given access to more equipment or are on the ledger to be given a leadership position in the future. They may lead raids, lead a squad during a raid, and shadow NCOs and officers doing training.


+ [Marauder] - [NCO]
- Authority over enlisted ranks. Issued orders during small raids, maintains group policy & standards within the general enlisted.

The NCOs of the ranks of Chaos, the third tier of personnel. Those who have
shown potential & taken the initiative during raids will be rewarded with this rank and entrusted with authority over the enlisted members of Chaos. Some may be rewarded this rank for their ability to teach others in the group, be it training or R&D.


+ [Corruptor] - [Trainer]
- Blanket term for all trainers. Authority over training, specifically the final authority (outside of officers) of their own specific training sessions.

Corruptors are both the best friend and obstacle to a cultist joining the group. They are the primary source of knowledge and also the one that they must seek approval from. The Corruptor serves as a cultist's only reliable avenue into the group and the only reliable (ha) source of information outside of this handbook. To the enlisted members, Corruptors are their guides to learning how to use their gear and help determine whether they are ready for further promotion or not.


+ [Chosen] - [Warrant Officer]
- Authority over enlisted personnel & NCOs, enforces the handbook & its guidelines, and leads a majority of raids.

The fourth tier of personnel. Those who have demonstrated skill and leadership that surpasses the norm. Enforces discipline within the troops and acts as a morale officer within the ranks. The first rank within the Command Division. Usually those the XO an CO of a division can rely on.


+ [Champion] - [Officer]
- Authority over the enlisted ranks, usually an XO of a division & entrusted with an important job crucial to smooth operations within the group.

Champions have been those favored most by the gods of Chaos & by their fellow enlisted men. Those who show much aptitude in leadership, inter-group relations, and internal affairs.


+ [Lord] - [General]
-Authority over all ranks but Overlord. Leads Divisions & has access to all the gear in the armory.

Lords of the Warp, the truly loyal who would lead our enlisted to victory. This rank is reserved for those that the Overlords have deemed worthy to serve at their side. Usually in the running to become Overlords themselves.


+ [Enforcer] - [Internal Affairs Officer]
- Deals with infractions within the group. Actively enforces the will of the Lords & Overlords.

Members that have shown themselves to be loyal without fault, and willing to go the extra length to enforce the will and policies of the command staff. The eyes, ears, and executioners of the Overlords. Typically picked from astute group members or former Overlords.


+ [Overlord] - [Commander]
-Absolute authority over all aspects of the group. There are three Overlords which run the group by council leadership. There will always be an odd number of them.

Warlords of the Ruinous Powers, Commanders of Chaos. Holds authority in all aspects Chaos. Their word is law. The Unholy favored warriors of the warp, who gather the heretical, betrayed, and damned into a brotherhood of Chaos Undivided.


### Divisions
There are TWO Combat Divisions within Chaos Indivisvm, and FOUR Auxiliary Divisions.

+ Ferrum - Heavy Support
The Moving Wall. Ferrum is the skull crushing hammer of Chaos Indivisvm. Consisting of the artillery & tanker squads of Chaos, these proud soldiers march through blood stained battlefields one boot in front of the other. Ferrum is the Phalanx to Mortis being the Calvalry. Ferrum’s role is to maintain the line and hold objectives. The Dark Gods help us should Ferrum’s line ever shatter.

+ Mortis - Fast Attack
Mortis is the Fast Attack division of Chaos Indivisvm. Their jobs in combat range throughout various combat roles, from air dominance, pushing the forward line, taking objectives and causing disarray within the enemy lines. Mortis has access to the fast moving vehicles, and troop transports primarily. If the enemy line is crushed and scattered Mortis is likely to blame. MORIS NO LONGER NEEDS PILOTS.

-The combat divisions act as your "class" when initially joining the group. As a Veteran, you will have access to gear from both.

+ Mechanicus - R&D
Mechanicus is a Non-Combat subdivision focused on the creations of War-machines. Responsible for the creation and maintenance of the tools of the trade. Anyone who has begun contributing to group projects can be made Mechanicus.

+ Cult - Recruitment
The Cult is the recruitment group of Chaos Indivisvm. Comprised of Cultists & Corruptors. Corruptors are NCOs and higher with Veterans accepted as Corruptors on a case by case basis.

+ Enforcer - Internal Affairs
A division that carries with it the responsibility of resolving internal drama in the group. Good sense for seeing issues before they become a problem. Made up of NCOs and Officers.

+ Command
An informal division compromised of all of the Chosen+ ranks within the group. Most decisions within the group get made with the input of all of command despite Overlords having the final say.

###. Additional Reading

+ Drama:
Drama will without a doubt exist in any community. Drama destroys the morale of the group, If you go out of your way to cause it you will be dealt with swiftly.
If someone is going out of their way to cause problems, contact an Enforcer.

+ Coping with Boredom:
- Don't be antisocial - Make friends, get on mumble and have fun! Discord is also an option now.
- Recruit - Go recruiting, visit sims and find new cultists.
- Build - Create things. There is a building platform above the sim and a Mechanicus room at the bottom of the base.
- Vidya - Grab a friend and CoOp some vidya! We have a Steam community group you can join to keep up with us & play a few rounds on whatever game!
- Roleplay - Roleplay has always been a part of the SL Community, and will continue to be so for quite some time. If this is more your taste, Go ahead and find a sim and have some fun! (we will make fun of you)
- Pictures - This might sound weird, but our sim is very photogenic- take pictures of the sim, or you on the sim, and share it on the forums!
- Forums - We have plenty of threads and discussions to participate in. Go ahead and knock yourself out.

+ Special Treatment:
Special Treatment between ranks is NOT permitted within Chaos. If someone is "punished" in an exceptionally light manner in comparison to other offenders of the same offense, notify an Enforcer & they will pass the information to the correct parties.
"Yiffing" for rank is HIGHLY PROHIBITED, If any solid proof is gathered of this situation the convicted parties will be immediately ejected.
WE ARE NOT A DATING SERVICE. LEAVE YOUR FEDORA AT THE DOOR. YOU WILL NOT GET DICK, PUSSY, BALLS, OR ASS WITHIN THE GROUP.

+ Off Sim Raid Policy
Offensive Operations against another military must be authorized by at least a NCO, given that said party isn't considered at risk of causing an incident. If said group has a high chance for an incident, such a raid must be conducted by a Champion or higher. NCO's normally organize between themselves who is leading raids and when.

+ Offensive and Defensive procedures
In order to understand how we fight in combat, it is important you read the below notecards.
