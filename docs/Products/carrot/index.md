## What is Carrot?

Carrot grants permissionless access to create community-driven programmable incentives, distributing rewards when set criteria are met.

Liquidity mining took off during the DeFi summer of 2020. Ever since, most projects have been taking a standard approach, which can be categorized as Farming 1.0. This method is commonly used to distribute governance tokens but without necessarily achieving a specific goal — just give out tokens and hope for the best.

Carrot changes that by enabling projects to run smarter and more efficient liquidity mining campaigns from start to finish. Projects can use Carrot to create tokens that reward users based on specific and programmable conditions being met. Carrot tokens can be given out to liquidity providers or awarded to community members who help achieve the stated goal.
