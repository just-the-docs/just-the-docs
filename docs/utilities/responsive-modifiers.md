# Responsive modifiers

Just the Docs spacing works in conjunction with a variety of modifiers that allow you to target specific screen sizes responsively. Use these in conjunction with spacing and display prefix and suffix classes.

| Modifier  | Screen size                          |
|:----------|:-------------------------------------|
| (none)    | All screens until the next modifier  |
| `xs`      | 320px (20rem) and up                 |
| `sm`      | 500px (31.25rem) and up              |
