# Breadcrumbs

When using the default layout, all pages except top-level pages will automatically have a list of 'breadcrumbs' at the top, linking to the parent page and to any higher-level ancestors.

The default layout does not provide an option to suppress the list of breadcrumbs. To do that, you would need to define a new layout, or override the file `_includes/components/breadcrumbs.html` (e.g., with an empty file).
