# Child Pages

By default, all parent pages will automatically have a so-called 'Table of Contents' at the bottom, showing links to all their child pages.

To disable this automatic list, set `has_toc: false` in the parent page's front matter.

## Example: disabling table of contents
{: .text-delta }

```yaml

has_toc: false
