# Creating And Setting Up A Question

---

In this section, you will learn how to create and set up questions for your Google Form.

## Adding and setting a Question to Your Form

<br />

If you have just followed the steps to set up your Google form, skip to step 2. If you do not see the question, or if you want to create more than one question, proceed to step 1.

1. Click on the plus icon.

2. Click on `Untitled Question` to enter your question. For example, "What is your favourite ice-cream flavour?"

3. Click on `Multiple choice` to select a type of question. A menu with question types will appear.

4. Click on the preferred question type.

    There are many different types of question that can be asked. For more information on question types, go to the [Type Of Questions](./typesOfQuestions.md) subsection.

5. (Optional) Click on the toggle beside the `Required` on the bottom right of the question. The colour of the toggle should change from white to another colour. To change a question to optional, click on the toggle again. The colour should change back to white.

Questions can either be optional, or required. By default, the questions are set to be optional (the toggle is white).
