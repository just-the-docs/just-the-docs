This file was previously used to "fix" the HTML produced by Jekyll for
highlighted code with line numbers. While it often resolves layout issues
from the missing HTML tags, it still generates invalid HTML (by placing
a `<table>` element within a `<code>` block). As such, we no longer
recommend using this workaround. For more information, see the
"Code snippets with line numbers" docs page:
https://just-the-docs.com/docs/ui-components/code/line-numbers/
(or, docs/ui-components/line-nos.md/)

The next portion of this file, including the comments and the workaround,
are preserved for backwards comptability.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The implementation was derived from the workaround provided by
Dmitry Hrabrov (DeXP) at
https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-compress-html/issues/71#issuecomment-188144901

EXPLANATION (OLD)

The HTML produced by Rouge highlighting with line numbers is of the form
`code table`. Jekyll always wraps the highlighted HTML
with `pre`. This wrapping is not only unnecessary, but also transforms
the conforming HTML produced by Rouge to non-conforming HTML, which
results in HTML validation error reports.

The fix removes the outer `pre` tags whenever they contain the pattern
`<table class="rouge-table">`.

Apart from avoiding HTML validation errors, the fix allows the use of
the [Jekyll layout for compressing HTML](http://jch.penibelst.de),
which relies on `pre` tags not being nested, according to
https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-compress-html/issues/71#issuecomment-172069842

USAGE

(Any names can be used for `some_var` and `some_language`.)

{% capture some_var %}
{% highlight some_language linenos %}
Some code
{% endhighlight %}
{% endcapture %}
{% include fix_linenos.html code=some_var %}

For code fences:

{% capture some_var %}
```some_language
Some code
```
{% endcapture %}
{% assign some_var = some_var | markdownify %}
{% include fix_linenos.html code=some_var %}

CAVEATS

The above does not work when `Some code` happens to contain the matched string
`<table class="rouge-table">`.

The use of this file overwrites the variable `fix_linenos_code` with `nil`.
