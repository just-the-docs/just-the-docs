# DXdao Documentation

___

## Welcome to the DXdao documentation book!  
  
This site is the number one location for DXdao information, tutorials and content. It will evolve alongside DXdao with consistent additions and modifications; as a result, these pages are to be considered “work-in-progress”.  
  
## What is DXdao

DXdao is a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, that develops, governs, and grows DeFi protocols and products. It was created in May of 2019 and brands itself as a highly scalable collective focused on the DeFi ecosystem.

The [**DXdao Manifesto**]({% link docs/Manifesto.md %}) and [**FAQ**]({% link docs/FAQ.md %}) are great places to get started.

## What can I do with DXD?

DXD token holders have an economic claim to DXdao´s profit. DXD holders also have future access to a suite of services and premium features in decentralized applications, such as gasless transactions, feeless anonymizing of assets, reduced trading fees on DEX protocols, and more.  
  
Read more in the [**DXD**]({% link docs/DXD.md %}) section.

## What products do DXdao own and operate?  
  
The suite of DeFi products built and governed by DXdao currently includes:

[**Omen**]({% link docs/Products/omen/index.md %}) – A fully decentralized multi-chain prediction market platform.

[**Swapr**]({% link docs/Products/swapr/index.md %}) – A multi-chain AMM with a suite of unique features including LP governance, DIY farming, and much more.

[**Mesa**]({% link docs/Products/mesa/index.md %}) – A fair auction IDO launchpad.
