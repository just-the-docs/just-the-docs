# at-import-no-partial-extension

Disallow file extensions in partial names in `@import`.

**Deprecated. Use [`at-import-partial-extension-blacklist`](/src/rules/at-import-partial-extension-blacklist/README.md) or [`at-import-partial-extension-whitelist`](/src/rules/at-import-partial-extension-whitelist/README.md) instead**

```scss
@import "path/to/file.scss"
/**                  ↑
 *       Disallow this */
```

The rule ignores [cases](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#import) when Sass considers an `@import` command just a plain CSS import:

* If the file’s extension is `.css`.
* If the filename begins with `http://` (or any other protocol).
* If the filename is a `url()`.
* If the `@import` has any media queries.

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```scss
@import "foo.scss";
```

```scss
@import "path/fff.less";
```

```scss
@import "path\\fff.supa";
```

```scss
@import "df/fff", '1.scss';
```

The following patterns are *not* considered warnings:

```scss
@import "path/fff";
```

```scss
@import url("path/_file.css"); /* has url(), so doesn't count as a partial @import */
```

```scss
@import "file.css"; /* Has ".css" extension, so doesn't count as a partial @import */
```

```scss
/* Both are URIs, so don't count as partial @imports */
@import "http://_file.scss";
@import "//_file.scss";
```

```scss
@import "file.scss" screen; /* Has a media query, so doesn't count as a partial @import */
```

## Optional Options

### `ignoreExtensions: [ string or regexp ]`

An array of extensions to ignore, elements *don't need the dot at the start*. If an element is a string, only extensions that match that string are ignored. If an element is a regular expression, then extensions are tested against it and ignored if the test is successful.

For example, with `ignoreExtensions: [ "scss", /^my/ ] ]`, the following are no longer warnings:

```scss
@import "path/fff.scss";
```

```scss
@import "path/fff.my01";
```
