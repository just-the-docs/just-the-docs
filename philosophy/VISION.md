# Vision

**Purpose**

Allows us to identify common threads, and meaningful changes, in Countable's vision over time.

**Scope**

Documents past and present vision statements for Countable.

## Vision Statement

Do you have a problem that might be solvable using the internet?

Our technology is an industry-agnostic method for testing solutions
quickly on the web. Our team developed and operates a cloud-based
solution to user and data management in diverse settings including
marine battery control systems, patient care, fisheries data management,
medical devices, real estate and more. We've solved the core web
technology problems faced by these organizations so they can focus on
delivering solutions to their customers. We prototype your solution in
weeks instead of months, based on an existing infrastructure that makes
it easy to demonstrate benefits immediately.

One of the many deployments we've built and currently maintain in
production is a patient engagement and queue system, which likely
overlaps the scope with the 'patient gateway' requested by the Ministry
of Health. According to its users, this system has dramatically improved
automated patient access to health care while reducing per-patient cost
by a large fraction.

Another of our products is a web-based widget platform that serves
content to tens of millions of users per day on over a million webpages.

Our mission is to re-invent how web technology is prototyped and
delivered and make it 10x easier for others to deliver their own
missions using the internet.

### Vision Statement (Original Draft 1)

Codify the many-faceted problem of web technology delivery, so it can be
abstracted away and simplified to allow everyone to better focus on
their customers. This should be done in a way that caters to the
situation of a business implementing the technology.

#### Back story

From Clark Van Oyen, Founder at Countable Web Productions.

#### Web Technology Is Still A Dark Art

Over the last decade my journey has involved systems for building out
web technology for businesses. This is largely still a dark art with
unique challenges. The best developers with this capability are
increasingly rare and the competition for their time is fierce. Even if
you do land the right person, they're likely to still miss some key
aspect such as:

  - Understanding business priorities and effectively encoding them in
    the nuances of the code and the software development process.
  - Properly mentoring others to fill their role later
  - Using techniques, platform, tools and architecture that others can
    understand and later take over.
  - Having a basic knowledge of security, privacy, copyright law of
    libraries, and other subtleties.
  - How to approach Testing, Deployment and Operational pipelines.

Finding Good Developers, keeping them around, assembling great teams,
transitioning their knowledge, and aligning their work with finding
product-market fit is very difficult and attempting it is expensive.

#### The Vision

What if we could codify web development over time to continuously spend
more time on the "good" stuff, focusing on your customers and
opportunities? What if you could have just a little access to all the
right deep domain knowledge in the context of your business? And, what
if we could do all the basic things right by default without needing a
team of amazing specialists.

This is the core idea behind Countable Consulting. To develop the
processes and tools to abstract away the multifaceted problem of
building a web technology team with conventions to get the little things
right by default.
