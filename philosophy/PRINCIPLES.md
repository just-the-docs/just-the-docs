# Principles

**Purpose**

Outlines the principles that drive Countable.

**Scope**

Relates principles to our OKRs process, then lists some key principles.

## Principles

The purpose of this page is to address a specific issue with our
[OKR](../operations/OKRS)
process, wherein by focusing exclusively on some OKR we neglect some
important assumption we should have had all along. ie, by releasing fast
we neglect privacy.

We list principles below in order of descending priority.

We may measure some of these principles, making them into "committed
OKRs".

  - *Results are sacred* - Processes, Roles, and other inputs are
    flexible and can be changed when necessary to achieve results.
  - *Ownership* - Take ownership, or be aware of who has taken ownership
    for any outcome we attempt. Tell each other "i've got this."
  - *Privacy through simplicity* - We MUST always be confident that
    anyone's private data is secure. When it comes to security private
    data, you SHOULD use the simplest solution as it's the most likely
    to be implemented correctly. The best is to never store private
    data. Then, if you must store it, minimize the number of people who
    can access it, and the ways the can access it.
  - *No complacency* - If something is unclear or suboptimal, we make
    some noise about it. Also, we should ensure there is a strong
    feedback loop between peers in a team, and between us, our clients
    and their customers. The output of what you do SHOULD be highly
    visible to those it impacts, and to you. Give, receive, and act on
    feedback as frequently and immediately as you can.
  - *Audacity* - We SHOULD do work that excites us and has a chance to
    change its industry.
  - *Transparency* - We SHOULD do everything in the most public place
    that doesn't endanger someone's privacy or property.
  - *Continuous Improvement* - Always work to make things a little
    better than you found them. Many small improvements add up.
  - *Prototyping* We publish simple but working models of products to
    real users, as a part of planning them, within weeks not months.
  - *Impact* - We strive to help as many people as possible as a
    side-effect of our work.
  - *Consistency* - We avoid arbitrary inconsistency. Create tools to
    automate and enforce consistency.
  - *Modelling* - We reduce complex phenonemna to simple predictive
    models. Help everyone on your project visualize the desired outcome.
  - *Diversity* - We MUST encourage diversity of thought, treat everyone
    with respect, and work to avoid non-meritocratic bias.
  - *Usability* - We create software with an enjoyable, engaging user
    experience. Don't make the user think, wait, or do a task
    unnecessarily.
  - *Asynchrony* - We prevent people needing to ask us for things, by
    putting all information and assets in a place our team can predict.
