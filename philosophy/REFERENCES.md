# Philosophical References

**Purpose**

To share the external ideas and resources which have helped shape our company's philosophy.

**Scope**

Currently consists primarily of resources on management styles and lists the books that most heavily influenced this ops manual.

## Management

Some resources in line with our thinking on management styles.

### Just Shut Up

  - [Data Driven Investor post](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/are-you-a-manager-shut-up-494616dcea2f)

### "The Culture Code"

Team performance can be predicted by:

1.  All members speak equally
2.  Members maintain eye contact
3.  Members communicate directly with each other
4.  Members break from the team to focus or explore, and bring skills
    back to the team

These are more important for individual performance, so a manager's job
is to create "belonging cues" which foster the above behaviours. These
things also happen to make it more enjoyable to work together, which is
also important. We need to build trust in each other that Countable is a
safe place to try your hardest, knowing the team will support you
whether you succeed or fail. We need to trust each other enough to give
honest feedback when it's hard, so we can help one another improve to
the next level without getting stuck in a rut. We push each other
because we have high expectations for the team, and trust each other to
reach them.

## References

Books that heavily influenced this manual are listed here. They are
recommended as having an influence on our company culture.

A general trend of these books is that they follow somewhat of a
narrative format so are easy to read. Countable will reimburse the
purchase of any of these books. For other professional development
materials you will usually be approved, but ask first.
