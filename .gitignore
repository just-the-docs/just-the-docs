_site/
.sass-cache/
.jekyll-cache/
.jekyll-metadata

# Ignore folders generated by Bundler
.bundle/

# We use Node.js as our runtime, so we ignore node_modules
node_modules

# .DS_Store is a macOS-only metadata file about directories. Convention is to not commit them.
# See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store

# These are legacy globs that typically target Ruby theme developers. We may change these at a later date.
