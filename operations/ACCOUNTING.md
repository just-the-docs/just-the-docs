**Purpose**

To cover the major points of accounting practices at Countable.

**Scope**

Currently touches upon any unique categories we track or pay attention
to, and how we do so.

## Timesheets and Expenses

`TODO: link out to eightmeters page`

## Taxes

### List of Tax Deductible Items

Anything purchased by Countable from [this list of eligible
items](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/sole-proprietorships-partnerships/business-expenses)
should be included in our tax deduction each year.

### Tax Categories

The CRA link above gives great detail on what can and cannot be claimed
for deduction, but we steer by a simpler set of categories internally.

\*\* Food\*\* We track food separately, as it's only 50% deductible.
Meals or drinks with clients, team outings, and in general anything that
falls within reasonable use in the business day can be tracked here.

**General Expenses** This covers "most everything else" - office
supplies and equipment, rent, and fees incurred in the process of doing
business.

**"Needs Checking"** It's useful to maintain an additional category code
while processing the data which batches together all line items needing
further verification or detail. This way, you're not stuck following up
on individual expenses and wasting a lot of time. By batching these,
they can be cross-verified to their relative accounts quickly and
efficiently.
