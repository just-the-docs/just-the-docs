<div class="toctree" data-maxdepth="2" data-caption="Contents:" hidden="">

</div>

**Purpose**

Operations covers the intersection of business best practices and
project management, uniting the best interests of devs and clients with
the company itself.

**Scope**

This document will give an initial overview of what operations is
presumed to cover in this case, plans for the operations guild at
Countable, and link out to more useful reference docs on our processes.

## Our Methodology Toolbox

In general, we do not take a prescriptive approach to methodology. We
use methodologies as a toolbox. First, seek to understand the problem as
deeply as possible. Then, evaluation methodologies and select those
which best address the specific context for your project.

Here is a guide to specific methods, and when to use each.

1)  *Scrum* - A versatile project management (PM) methodology which
    provides efficient change management (via backlog), regular meetings
    with stakeholders, continuous deployment and project velocity
    measurement. Use for any project with stakeholders who will be
    engaged throughout the project. The more and the greater variety of
    stakeholders, the more important a fully implemented PM methodology
    (Scrum) is needed.
2)  *Prototyping* - Man plans, god laughs. Instead of planning every
    detail (guessing), why not build a quick approximation of your end
    goal? Prototyping an excellent way to conduct and validate planning.
    A cheap prototype lets you validate technical feasibility, market
    fit, usability and aesthetics without guessing (planning). Use for
    any novel product (different from existing ones), particularly if
    there may be many unknown unknowns to test for.
3)  *Wireframes* - A lighter prototype that only includes the navigation
    (page structure) of your product. Use for any product with
    non-trivial use cases. Useful if a design process may come later and
    coding is being done first.
4)  *Use cases* - Determine who will use the product, and how. What
    specific goals do users have and what steps does your product take
    to fulfill them?
5)  *User stories* - A variation on Use Cases, and part of Scrum.
    Emphasizes a deep understanding of the Actor's point of view and
    context. Use for any new project that involves developing a product.
6)  *Visual Mockups* - A non-functional prototype. Displays the exact
    look of the finished product. Use for any public facing product.
    Useful if wireframes or an unattractive prototype already exist, or
    for brand new projects.
7)  *SEO Research* - Focused on search engines, but serves well as a
    general purpose market research tool. Identify what words your
    market uses, and the volume of searches with those words. Then, get
    ranked well for them. Use to understand and acquire customers.
8)  *Usability testing* - Observe actual users interacting with your
    product, and identify obstacles and opportunities in their
    behaviour. Use on flows you need the user to complete reliably.
9)  *Creative brief* - A lightweight design process kick-off document to
    identify the project goal, audience, proposed tone/character, and
    summarize design deliverables. Use before undertaking substantial
    creative/branding work.

## Processes at Countable

Processes are the official rules defined in this manual which we all
commit to work by.

We prefer to have a small set of official processes to produce better,
more meaningful work faster, achieve our mission, and have more fun
doing it. Processes have a cost, so we want the minimum set to
accomplish this.

### Process Conventions

Most processes will start out as conventions. As you work, experiment
and try things. When you can demonstrate something is working really
well, we should consider making it an official process.

### Process Drafts

The first step for an official process is to write it up in this manual
as a draft. The purpose of this is to make it clear and let teammates
test whether it's useful.

The proposed process should:

  - Have a clear benefit that outweighs its cost substantially. When in
    doubt, eliminate the process.
  - Be as simple with the minimum number of steps necessary.
  - Be informed by our own experiences and evidence first, consultation
    with colleagues second, best practices third (processes well known
    and contained in multiple industry standards), and specific
    literature from a single author a distant fourth.
  - Be aligned with our mission.

### Testing A New Process

Don't rush a new process. Trial it first:

  - Document the process in this operations manual as a *draft*. Be
    clear about when the process applies, what the roles are and why
    it's worth having in concise simple language.
  - Explain the process to team members, and get feedback. Testing a
    process is a consultative decision.
  - Lead by example, and update your process document as you learn.
  - Review the process with the team and decide if you want to propose
    it company-wide.

### Making Processes Official

  - The process must be approved by the company's Director.
  - Remove the *draft* status from the ops manual page. It's now
    official.

### Company Structure / Governance

Countable is an agency that uses consulting as a source of information
to build start-ups.

Countable has projects, and some of those projects can turn into new
businesses (KMC\_shfits turned into Cortico in this case). Those
businesses stay in the team as a project for all intends and purposes at
first, but over time they may become more independent. This depends on
when they need space to focus on different problems than Countable. This
model is to help us reconcile the difference between consulting and
start-ups. Consulting is a source of information to help us understand
problems in the world. If we solve a problem in this area which is
replicable, we can spin it off into a new product/business.

### COVID-19 Safety Plan

For all staff and subcontractors:

  - As a remote-first company, it's much easier for us to manage
    COVID-19 safety by default.
  - Do not attend the office if you have any symptoms.
  - If you do attend the office, avoid touching your face, approaching
    within 6 feet of a colleague, and wash your hands regularly.
  - If you suspect you may be infected, refer to the Cortico COVID-19
    screening form for a list of symptoms and book an appointment if you
    have concerns at
