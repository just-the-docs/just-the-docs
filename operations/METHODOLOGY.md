# Methodology Toolkit

**Purpose**

To outline our toolbox approach to methodology.

**Scope**

Covers nine specific tools and methods, as well as when to use each.

## Our Methodology Toolbox

In general, we do not take a prescriptive approach to methodology. We
use methodologies as a toolbox. First, seek to understand the problem as
deeply as possible. Then, evaluation methodologies and select those
which best address the specific context for your project.

Here is a guide to specific methods, and when to use each.

1)  *Scrum* - A versatile project management (PM) methodology which
    provides efficient change management (via backlog), regular meetings
    with stakeholders, continuous deployment and project velocity
    measurement. Use for any project with stakeholders who will be
    engaged throughout the project. The more and the greater variety of
    stakeholders, the more important a fully implemented PM methodology
    (Scrum) is needed.
2)  *Prototyping* - Man plans, god laughs. Instead of planning every
    detail (guessing), why not build a quick approximation of your end
    goal? Prototyping an excellent way to conduct and validate planning.
    A cheap prototype lets you validate technical feasibility, market
    fit, usability and aesthetics without guessing (planning). Use for
    any novel product (different from existing ones), particularly if
    there may be many unknown unknowns to test for.
3)  *Wireframes* - A lighter prototype that only includes the navigation
    (page structure) of your product. Use for any product with
    non-trivial use cases. Useful if a design process may come later and
    coding is being done first.
4)  *Use cases* - Determine who will use the product, and how. What
    specific goals do users have and what steps does your product take
    to fulfill them?
5)  *User stories* - A variation on Use Cases, and part of Scrum.
    Emphasizes a deep understanding of the Actor's point of view and
    context. Use for any new project that involves developing a product.
6)  *Visual Mockups* - A non-functional prototype. Displays the exact
    look of the finished product. Use for any public facing product.
    Useful if wireframes or an unattractive prototype already exist, or
    for brand new projects.
7)  *SEO Research* - Focused on search engines, but serves well as a
    general purpose market research tool. Identify what words your
    market uses, and the volume of searches with those words. Then, get
    ranked well for them. Use to understand and acquire customers.
8)  *Usability testing* - Observe actual users interacting with your
    product, and identify obstacles and opportunities in their
    behaviour. Use on flows you need the user to complete reliably.
9)  *Creative brief* - A lightweight design process kick-off document to
    identify the project goal, audience, proposed tone/character, and
    summarize design deliverables. Use before undertaking substantial
    creative/branding work.
