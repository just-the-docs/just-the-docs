# Scrum

**Purpose**

Countable uses
[Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_\(software_development\)) to
manage work delivery and collaboratively learn about problem domains.

**Scope**

This page briefly summarizes SCRUM principles, then focuses on how we
actually put it into action at Countable.

For more, check out the guide book from the inventor of Scrum
[here](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).

## Principles

1.  Ship work to real users and get feedback *every sprint*. Don't allow
    "work in progress" to not be released. Instead, plan your work so it
    can be released every 2 weeks or *ideally, every day*.
2.  Make sure everyone's clear regarding their *Objectives* and team
    members' Objectives and Key Results.
3.  *Communicate* with your project team daily about meeting KRs.

## User Stories

User Stories serve as the central planning document for any given
project. The purpose of User Stories is to ensure all stakeholders can
understand what we're trying to accomplish, no matter their level of
technical expertise. Check out the [User Stories](operations/USER_STORIES/) page for more detail and how
to compose User Stories.

## SCRUM Process

### Project Objective and Key Results

Every team should have one or more [Objectives](operations/OKRS/). This is a written goal discussed with the team to ensure clarity, and is used by the **Product Owner** toorder the **Backlog**. An objective may be to meet a  particular [UserStory](operations/USER_STORIES/).
 
### Sprint

A sprint is a period (1 week to 1 month) punctuated by a Sprint meeting.

The **Scrum Master** must review tickets for clarity (triage them) from
Requests to Backlog. The **Product Owner** must review tickets for
priority (order the **Backlog**).

#### Before Sprint Review meetings, team members should:

1.  Measure what % done our Key Results are. Check any metrics necessary
    so we don't bog down the meeting looking in mixpanel for example.
2.  Pick cards for the next sprint that will most impact KRs.

#### During the sprint meeting

Each team member updates the team on their

1.  Key Result scores
2.  what they shipped to cause those changes
3.  and how they will meet the Key Results by the deadline (usually end
    of month)

#### Cards of Shame

1.  Review any cards left in the sprint column. Why are they there? How
    can we avoid that?

#### Stand-up Meetings

Countable doesn't hold synchronous stand-up meetings. Instead, every
day, please share something on your team's public slack channel
regarding the work you did. It's best to show a screenshot of your work
for feedback.

### SCRUM Roles

These are the duties we must assigned when doing Scrum.

#### Product Owner

  - Develops User Stories by talking to real users and ensures those
    users' needs are being met by the team.
  - Clarifies how to achieve our [Key Results](operations/OKRS/),
    while taking input from team.
  - Triage the Trello Requests column into an Ordered Backlog of work.
  - Makes sure items in the backlog are clear to developers. The product
    owner is typically our client.

#### Scrum Master

  - Chair the sprint meeting, ensuring we follow the process.
  - Trains the team on Scrum and makes sure we're following the rules of
    scrum effectively (shipping each week, continuously learning, making
    tickets clear)
  - Nudge team to identify problems in workflow and make them visible to
    work together.

#### Developers (and other technicians)

  - Ensures they have a challenging yet doable amount of work each
    sprint.
  - Ensure they understand items in their sprint, an complain otherwise.
  - Takes responsibility for completing KRs, and shipping work to real
    users, clients, and team members (depending on output)

### Backlog

The Backlog is a list of all the actions we current believe will
accomplish the goal of our project. This should be ordered by impact to
effort ratio. That is, items which make the biggest difference in the
least time should be done first.

We do not have daily stand-up meetings since our team works in different
timezones. Instead, we have a slack channel where people should
communicate about what they're working on, coordinate code reviews, and
figure out logistics to ship their work every week, and generate ideas
for the sprint plan meeting.

For a visual aid of how our work is processed, see this [Business Process Diagram](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VrniT1lRqVu9sJr0ZMK1aQLnFwEuFIQD).

Note: Instead of just talking about what did you do this week, try to
use a screen share feature to walk along all of your "done" trello
tickets, explaining one by one. This helps the team to better understand
all of your work.
