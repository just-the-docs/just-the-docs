# Working With Government

**Purpose**

To optimize our project management spin-up for government RFPs and projects.

**Scope**

Covers the aggregated technical requirements and practices we've accumulated while working with BC Provincial government contracts.

## Working With Government (Requirements)

Here is a high-level summary of requirements when working in the public
sector.

When working for the Ministry of the Attorney General:

  - Do not make public announcements of unreleased work in progress
    (post to instagram, etc) without approval.
  - Observe our IT Security Policy.
  - Do not promote the Province of BC being our customer in marketing
    materials (promotional purposes) without prior written consent.
  - You need to go through a process for accessing protected information
    from the Province, including a criminal background check.
  - We cannot have a terms of use agreement with anyone regarding the
    work we produce for the Province (6.7, SI Contract).
  - Do not use production data in development, test or training
    environments without consent from the Province.
  - Use CloudFlare infront of all services deployed, as it provides
    various security requirements.
  - Automatic security patching must be enabled on all production
    servers.
  - Use GitHub's CVE detection system and patch any detected
    vulnerabilities prior to launch (use a CD gate).
