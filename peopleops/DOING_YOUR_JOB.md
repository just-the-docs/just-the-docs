**Purpose**

Describing the processes and norms of getting our jobs done at
Countable. Make sure to check out our `/peopleops/ONBOARDING_GUIDE`
first\!

**Scope**

Covers our team management platform Eightmeters, workflow checklists,
remote work basics, professional conduct, setting up your desk,
expenses, and a subcontractor's guide.

## Using Eightmeters

At Countable, we built [Eightmeters](https://eightmeters.countable.ca/)
to overcome some of the challenges of remote work. Make sure to log your
time daily according to appropriate project tags, including links to
appropriate Trello cards or document deliverables when possible.

## Workflow Checklist

This workflow checklist covers mostly things we should already be doing.
If it's something we're still working towards, it's in *italics*.

### Meetings

  - Be on time, or notify as early as possible about absence or lateness
    and offer something instead (here's my summary so you can read it).
    See Commitments, below.
  - *Everyone should share something. Prepare what you want to say (that
    fits the meeting agenda), and even send it to team members before
    the meeting.*
  - If you have a proposal or idea, write it up in detail, and share it
    ahead of time. Indicate how it impacts something we care about
    (OKR).

### Commitments

  - Be clear and specific about commitments. Say "I'll send you a
    prototype link at 2pm" rather than "I'll be done after lunch". *This
    should be in writing, such as in a Trello ticket (in this case, set
    a deadline on the ticket too.)*
  - If you're not going to meet a commitment, tell the team as early as
    possible, and explain what the gap will be, and how close you are.
    Explain what else you can do to help.

### Every Day You Work

  - Share something with the team every day. The simplest way to do this
    is to report what you did on Slack in your team's channel, and
    anything you're stuck on. Shooting a quick [screen cap
    video](https://countable-ops-manual.readthedocs.io/operations/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT#tools-screencastify)
    to share is a great idea to try out.
  - Check slack twice a day at least, and react/respond to some other
    team members' posts.
  - Commit your code and push it to bitbucket every day.
  - Fill your timesheet (end of the day)
  - Check your company Email

### Every Week

  - Communicate with each client you are working with. Send them an
    update on what's done and what's pending out of their current
    expectations. Include a link to staged work, and a screenshot or
    video. It's best to do this Friday or Monday.
    [Transparency](https://countable-ops-manual.readthedocs.io/philosophy/PHILOSOPHY#transparency-policy)

### Do Not

  - Use private messages for things that don't need to be private. Share
    your experiences on your projects in your client channel, and if
    it's more widely applicable, (\#client-) in \#general.
    [Transparency](https://countable-ops-manual.readthedocs.io/philosophy/PHILOSOPHY#transparency-policy)

## Time Off

Countable's intention is allow a great deal of flexibility to everyone,
while ensuring we work at predictable times and can depend on one
another. The important things are to make sure your team can rely on you
being around when you say you will, and that you don't burn out. So, you
can generally work when you want, but you should communicate when that
will be.

  - Employees (not subcontractors) based in Canada are subject to labour
    laws and as such have vacation pay, stat holidays, over-time, etc.
  - Sub-contractors may take unpaid leave any time, and should take at
    least 2 weeks throughout the year.
  - By default, assume your team mates won't work on Canadian stat
    holidays or weekends, so don't be surprised if you do not get a
    response to messages. However, you are welcome to work
  - Everyone must plan and document their regular hours in the [staff
    schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zh6GYex7UtoZGyChRGNy8378brtxvfrOdtedf6z5c5M/edit#gid=0).
    These should comprise at least half of the hours you work.
  - If you are away during scheduled time, please let your team know in
    advance and help them plan. If it's less than a day, same-day or
    one-day advance notice is fine. If it's more than a day, notify your
    team members a few days in advance. Note your absence on the
    Countable Absences shared calendar.
  - We expect remote team members outside of the America/Vancouver
    timezone to have a 50% overlap with the Vancouver timezone (work
    half their time in PST).
  - Remove yourself from calendar events you won't attend.

## Remote Work Basics

Countable is a fully remote team, which has certain pros and cons. The
top "cons" reported on other remote teams are:

  - Loneliness / Isolation
  - Collaborating / Communicating

Things to try.

  - Weekly team Lunch. Can we schedule a video call for a weekly lunch?
    Figure out what day works for everyone.
  - Shorter coffee-break video call, daily.
  - Video collaboration time on projects. Casual mob coding, async
    coding allowed too.
  - review: [Gitlab Remote work

## Professional Conduct

How to communicate with clients, and general practices. TLDR: Act
professionally with clients. You're given flexibility (schedule,
location, school) at Countable because we trust you to minimize the
impact of those things on clients.

### Maintaining Professionalism with Clients

As a team, Countable leans towards being casual with one another. In
general, we believe this is a strength. However, we must keep in mind
that we are also a *consultancy*, which means we offer high value
knowledge based services analogous to those of a doctor or lawyer. In
the same way a doctor's work is of life and death consequence, our own
work is critical for the privacy and security of our users, and critical
for the business success of our clients.

It's true we have a culture that is relaxed in terms of language and
clothing among our team, have time off with flexible hours, and do our
best to accomodate each person's lifestyle.

However, we are very serious about doing high quality work for our users
and clients, and maintaining their confidence by acting professionally.
In practice this means:

  - We allow people to work from anywhere in the world, and have
    flexible schedules. However, we do our best to prevent our clients
    needing to worry about this.
  - It's not a secret if you're taking classes, travelling overseas,
    etc. But we don't advertise these things to the client. If the
    client asks, you can discuss it, but don't volunteer this
    information because the conversation should be about our client (not
    you, and not Countable).
  - If you can't make a specific meeting time, do not offer the reason.
    The client does not need to know it's because you have another
    business meeting, classes, or it's the middle of the night where you
    are.
  - When meeting clients over video, work from a well-lit room, and wear
    clean, reasonable clothing that you'd wear to a job interview.
  - Never be late (even a few minutes) for meetings, especially when
    clients are involved. If you are, apologize because the reality is
    you've just wasted people's time.
  - Always reply to clients' emails or Trello comments within 24 hours
    with a resolution. This means, it should be clear what the next step
    is, by whom. If the item doesn't require action, say so - "We can
    revisit this in the future."

## Setting Up Your Desk

### Equipment Requirements

You'll need:

  - Good quality headset with mic. Cheap options we've verified to work
    well:
    [wired](https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Microphone-Cancelling-Lightweight-Headphones/dp/B06XWG12QS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1531614591&sr=8-2&keywords=headset+wired+-wireless#customerReviews)
    or
    [bluetooth](https://www.amazon.com/New-bee-Bluetooth-Cancelling-Headsetcase/dp/B07FMSJZ3R).
    Countable will reimbuse up to $40 on this.
  - A computer. If you're a developer, it should have either Linux or
    MacOS (we don't use Windows for work). If you're a developer or
    designer, you want 4GB or more of RAM, 128GB or more of disk, and a
    core i3 or better CPU. We recommend dell XPS series OR a desktop. We
    recommend Ubuntu LTS or Elementary OS.
  - A quiet, hopefully cool, room to work from with a stable internet
    connection. When you `ping 8.8.8.8` you should get no dropped
    packets or numbers over 100ms.

### Equipment Expenses

  - Any expense over $100 must be approved in advance of the purchase in
    order to be reimbursed.
  - Countable will provide a (loaner) linux laptop if you use that as
    your primary work machine. We subsidize Linux because it helps the
    team learn about our servers, Docker and other critical components
    of our business that use Linux. We want a bias to moving as much
    infrastructure in that direction as possible but recognize not
    everything works there yet (Adobe, I'm looking at you).
  - Countable will pay 50% up to $1000 total every 2 years for computer
    equipment you use for work remotely, which is owned by you
    personally. If the expense would bring the total claimed over $1000
    in the 2 year period prior to the current date, the claim is not
    reimbursed.
  - We studiously avoid Microsoft Windows at Countable. It's not as
    automatable as Linux, and prevents people from learning Unix which
    is a core competency at Countable. To be eligible for
    resimbursement, Windows laptops must also have Linux installed on a
    partition (bootable, not a VM).
  - Special expenses may be approved if required for your job. These
    must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis prior to purchase. ie,
    Countable may pay for co-working space if you need one.
  - Expenses at or below $100 are not approved in advance but are
    reviewed instead for reimbursement (you can ask if you're not sure,
    but if you can solve any real problem for $100 or less, ask for
    forgiveness rather than permission.) See the next section for
    guidelines.

## Expenses

### Examples of Things The Company Will Pay For

  - Grammarly pro
  - Adobe CS (if you work in a design capacity)
  - Professional Books
  - Other professional development costs (approval in advance is
    required)
  - Monthly company outings.
  - Small equipment or other costs for the office.
  - Any meals you share with your team members or clients.
  - Some computer equipment, see Setting Up Your Desk above.
  - Hotels/flights when travelling for business.

### Claiming Expenses

Note your expenses in [Eightmeters](http://eightmeters.countable.ca)

## Subcontractor's Guide

Currently covers taxes, categorization as a subcontractor, and benefits
of incorporating.

Also check out our template `SUBCONTRACTOR_AGREEMENT`

### Taxes

You have to claim self employment income once per year. We recommend
using [SimpleTax](https://simpletax.ca/)

1.  We suggest signing up with mint.com, as it makes tracking all your
    expenses simpler.
2.  Save all receipts for restaurants. You can deduct 50%
3.  Computer equipment, deduct % used for work.
4.  Internet, phone, deduct % used for work.
5.  Rent, deduct the percentage of the room used for work, times
    percentage of time working there.
6.  Deduct travel costs when working.
7.  Full list -[CRA Business
    Expenses](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/sole-proprietorships-partnerships/business-expenses)

### Categorization as a Subcontractor

1.  You should supply your own computer equipment
2.  You should determine where, when and how the work will be done.
3.  Bears risk of loss, damage or delay.

### Should You Incorporate?

This section is only if you're in Canada for now.

1.  If you're working full time, it's likely worth it, otherwise
    probably not.
2.  It costs $400ish to incorporate (form a CCPC), plus $40/yr. You also
    need to spend a day or so on extra book keeping, and a day doing an
    extra tax return each year. You'll likely want to pay an accountant
    $1000 to do the return for you, or get corporate tax software for
    $150 or up. **The real cost is something like $2000 per year when
    you start.**
3.  The main tax benefit is you can defer income to another year to stay
    in a lower tax bracket. The corporate tax rate for small businesses
    is only about 15%, so if you want to save money for several years
    it's likely a good idea to leave that portion in your corporation
    rather than pay the 45% tax rate. If you're going to save the money
    for quite a while, fill up your RRSPs first. Then start saving it in
    your CCPC.

### Things You Can Deduct From Taxes

Countable doesn't reimburse these things but if you're a subcontractor
you can deduct them from your income to avoid tax.

  - The percentage of your rent or mortgage interest used for work
    (divide the area and time you use by the total, ie 300 square feet
    out of 900 square feet, times 8 hours a day out of 24 hour a day, is
    10% of your rent)
  - Any food or beveraged purchased and consumed during work hours.
  - Any equipment you use for work.
