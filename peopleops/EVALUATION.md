**Purpose**

To outline a clear, fair, and replicable process for performance
evaluation at Countable.

**Scope**

Covers our process for self-evaluation, technical tracks and their
levels, and the dismissal process.

The purpose of this policy is to "get and keep the right people on the
bus" \[1\].

This page lists "job levels". Each employee should be assigned a level
based on the behaviours listed below from levels 1 to 4.

## Performance Evaluation Overview

We've created a replicable process for self-evaluation which will
continue to be developed and improved. This will be completed twice a
year, roughly in July and in January. A copy of the related evaluation
spreadsheet will be assigned to you as a Trello card in Admin and
Operations at this time.

This is meant to be a self-reflective process, not a stressful one.
Independently reflect on your work at Countable over the previous six
months and try to answer as honestly as you can.

Here are the components to be tracked:

1.  **OKR score**: What is your average score the last 6 months?
2.  What do you score in the **general criteria** for your level? You
    can assign yourself 0, 0.5, or 1. (In order to progress to the next
    level, you must achieve at least 75% on these)
3.  What do you score in the **guild-specific criteria** for your level?
    (You must achieve these fully to progress to the next level)
4.  What is your **biggest opportunity for improvement** (getting to the
    next level, career-wise), and **your top strength** that we should
    support?

Provide this information to your manager for feedback, and they will
share any adjustments and their perspective on your answers. Your
manager should indicate their perspective on your biggest opportunity
for improvement and strength as well.

### General Criteria

For each job level, the general criteria are roughly grouped into three
broader categories of skills:

  - **PD** - personal development
  - **CM** - communication
  - **PM** - project management

### Technical Track Criteria

  - DevOps
  - Developer
  - UX / Design
  - Operations

The track your performance evaluation is based on is the one most
closely corresponding to your main job responsibilities. You are free to
be a part of of other guilds, of course, but you will only be
self-evaluating based on tasks from your main track.

## Evaluation Questions by Job Level

This section is used in the Process above for self-evaluation.

### Level 1

An internship or Junior. Evaluation of fit to Countable's culture, work
style and technical needs.

**Professional Development**

  - Regularly reviews other team members' work, and asks questions about
    it (code reviews, XD links, shared videos, stage sites)
  - You are dependable. The team feels they can rely on you do follow
    through with things. You document tasks (Trello usually) and follow
    up on them.
  - Tries to solve problems yourself. But then, asks questions.

**Communications**

  - Makes meetings on time, checks both email and slack daily, and
    notifies of absence in advance (and follows communications charter)
  - Often refers to the operations manual, and asks questions about it
    when something is unclear or could be improved.
  - Makes consistent improvement of any size to the systems around you
    (flag outdated content from the ops manual, small refactors such as
    renaming a variable for clarity, make a small design or usability
    improvement).
  - Shows gratitude to the team (for example, mention them in the
    \#thanks channel) or thank them on other channels.
  - Shares work (screenshots, staging links, XD links, code snippets)
    with the team and clients in your client- and guild- channels,
    because seeing great work raises the bar for everyone and is very
    motivating.

**Project Management**

    be in a meeting if you don't contribute.
  - Checks OKRs mid-month, and asks for help.

## Dismissal

While it sounds like a negative thing, not everyone is a fit for
Countable's culture. We think many people are talented but could have a
bigger impact elsewhere which is better for everyone. Things that could
result in you being dismissed:

  - Fail to communicate with users, team, and customers resulting in
    problems.
  - Fail to exhibit most of the behaviours listed at and below your
    current job level.
  - Fail to take responsibility when you make a mistake, and learn how
    to prevent it next time.
  - Miss meetings or appointments.
  - Lose track of client requests because they're not properly logged in
    Trello, or backlog's not monitored.
  - Produce low quality work that's not thoughtful of our future selves
    and which the team wouldn't be proud of.
  - Avoid hard discussions and be a "yes person" without thinking about
    what you're agreeing to.
  - Go "dark" so clients and team mates are unclear about the project
    status (no response for over 1 business day, when a response is
    clearly expected)
