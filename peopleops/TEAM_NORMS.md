# Team Norms at Countable

**Purpose**

Establishes the norms and policies which guide our collaboration at
Countable.

**Scope**

Covers our principles of diversity and inclusion, training, performance
evaluation, and team events.

## Diversity and Inclusion Principles

Here we outline core principles which allow us to approach our
differences in a respectful and positive way, and focus on building a
shared culture based on empathy and common goals.

1.  Countable does not tolerate non-meritocratic bias. We respect and
    support everyone the same, regardless of race, gender, religion or
    other attributes not related to our work. This also means there is
    as a general rule no special provisions made for these groups except
    to prevent, and to eliminate specific cases of, biases.
2.  Don't conflate ignorance and malice. It's the responsibility of
    minority groups coach the team on what's considered respectful, and
    it's the team's responsibility to listen and make an effort to be
    culturally respectful.
3.  If any team member is aware of disrespectful conduct, it must be
    reported. A manager will issue a warning the first time, and if it
    recurs, immediate dismissal. The warning must be made public to the
    team so everyone can see what happened, worded in a way that doesn't
    intrude on the victim's privacy (the aggressor's privacy is not an
    issue here).
4.  It's the manager’s responsibility to create an environment where the
    victim feels safe and comfortable enough to speak up. Any victim is
    protected by the company against any retribution for speaking up and
    is celebrated for their bravery in doing so. Please do speak up so
    we can solve the problem for everyone.
5.  This policy is NOT intended to discourage negative feedback on our
    work. Negative professional feedback, offered with empathy and from
    your professional peers is one of the fastest professional
    development tools.
6.  Countable acknowledges that gender bias is sadly still prevalent in
    the technology industry in particular. Our goal is to lead by
    example in creating a safe and supportive environment for women (and
    everyone else of course) to work.

## Compensation Strategy Principles

Covers our basic principles and approach to compensating our team; not
everyone will agree with this approach, so it's important we state it
here so we don't have someone with different expectations join the team.

1.  Our approach is to pay people enough to live in reasonable comfort
    and to generally be competitive with other opportunities but we
    would rather start with lower rates and give generous raises
    compared to other companies. This is very important, because if we
    pay too high initially it will result in many staff joining because
    of the high pay, and not because they are a good fit with our many
    unusual values and methods, in order to preserve our culture.
2.  Once an employee has completed some OKRs and demonstrated they can
    push the team towards our mission, they will get a substantial
    raise. At this point, we trust they've been vetted to be a cultural
    fit. The raise will be weighted towards stock so that our greated
    contributors are co-owners of Countable Web Productions Inc.
3.  This will absolutely lead to unequal pay - if you're good you'll be
    paid a lot more than someone who's still learning to be productive.
    On the positive side, this allows us to afford to hire students who
    still have some basic knowledge to develop in order to be
    productive. I think this is great because it will attract people who
    propel us forward over time, and avoid accumulating people who
    coast, by encouraging them to either improve or leave. It's much
    more motivating working with the former people.
4.  If you're assigned a change in compensation, that will take a effect
    starting in your next pay period, not immediately, nor backdated to
    past hours.

### Benefits

1.  Payment for benefits and expenses directly reimbursable will be
    included like other expenses, alongside payroll.
2.  If necessary, the company will purchase a linux computer for you.
    The specs will be commensurate with what your manager decides you
    need after discussing your job. You may not all get the same specs
    as others at the company.

#### Extended Medical

We don't currently have an extended medical group insurance plan (partly
as we don't yet have USA employees who tend to be more reliant on this),
but we'd like to help out a little when our team has dental or other
uninsured medical costs. In the future, we plan to improve our coverage
of medical costs but this is a start.

1.  Full time contractors (100h/mo or more) and employees receive 50%
    reimbursement for medical expenses, up to $1000 CAD per calendar
    year.
2.  Part time contractors (50h/mo or more) receive 30% reimbursement for
    medical expenses, up to $1000 CAD per calendar year.

## Guilds and Teams

Countable is divided into Teams and Guilds. The job of Guilds is to be
really good at specific things, and the job of Teams is to get results
for customers. This document lists our existing Guilds and Teams.

**List of Guilds**

  - `/devops/DEVOPS` - Their goal is to ensure our software is delivered
    to customers as quickly, reliably and automatically as possible.
  - `/programming/DEVELOPERS` - Their goal is to improve our code, solve
    problems for users, and demonstrate working software to our team
    every day.
  - `/ux/UX` - Their goal is to help everyone, from users to product
    owners and developers, enjoy and benefit from interacting with our
    software.
  - `/operations/OPERATIONS` - Their goal is maintaining clear and open
    communication with our clients, and maintaining the roadmap to
    sustainable growth for our firm.

**Cross-Functional Teams**

We have cross-functional teams organized by Objective. For example, we
have a `bawkbox` team whose top level objective is to make it easy for
any website to install any 3rd party widget.

With each of our clients, we form a team with some of our staff.

Countable does not have functional team divisions by job role.

**Other Informal Groups**

On some occasions other groups may organize for professional development
or other purposes. These are not `teams` in our company's terminology.

## Training at Countable

We have official training materials here: `/programming/TRAINING`. Bill
for your time doing any of these.

**Books**

If you buy a book for work, the company will reimburse you.

:doc:</span>/philosophy/REFERENCES\` that's influenced our culture and
methods.

**Monthly Guild Meetings**

Each month we hold a meeting for any technical specialty the team is
interested in. Currently there's a developer guild meet, a devops meet,
an operations meet, and a design/ux guild meet.

## Performance Evaluation Policy

See our dedicated `/programming/EVALUATION`

## Team Event Basics

As a company with remote employees, we intend that half of recreational
events can be attended online.

When in-person events are held in just one city, employees may
self-organize events in their respective cities and be reimbursed by
Countable. The default cap is $25/person, for other amounts please get
approval from your manager.
