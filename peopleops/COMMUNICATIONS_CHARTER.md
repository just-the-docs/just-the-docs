# Communications Charter 

**Purpose**

Help everyone at Countable understand how to indicate their
availability, reach out to others using various appropriate channels,
conduct meetings of appropriate scope, get feedback on our work every
day, and give feedback to our teammates.

**Scope**

Define how we designate our availability to the team, use different
communication channels for different purposes, utilize feedback loops to
get better at our work, and communicate with teammates.

## Availability

  - Each team member determines their own hours and communicates that to
    the team.
  - We assume most people will not work on weekends or stat holidays,
    but you are welcome to. Try to work on your own on holidays so you
    don't pull someone in who was planning the day off.
  - While there are occasional emergencies that may require it, we try
    to minimize the pressure on people to work beyond 8 hours a day.
  - Indicate what hours you will work using [Google's Work Hours](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en) in your Countable Calendar. This isn't written in stone but allows your team members to plan when to work with you. If you change it one day, just let your team know in advance.
  - If your time zone or responsibilities make it difficult to put the "complete picture" here, make sure there are at least two major slots of 4+ hours booked for Vancouver business hours (9-5, M-F Pacific time).

## Guidelines for All Communication

We want to restrict types of communication by channel so people aren't
stressed by having to listen on all channels at all times. 

For example, we expect people to check email just once or twice a day, and not on evenings or weekends, so don't feel guilty about not checking it on your time off.

  - Where possible, communication is `asynchronous` because we have
    different schedules and often timezones too. This means it will
    often be a few hours or even a day before you get a response to
    Slack or Email messages.
  - For complex or emotionally charged conversations use voice
    (appear.in or phone)
  - Being brief in email/slack amongst ourselves is ok.
  - There are arguably two "modes" that people work in. "Focus mode" and
    "Collaboration mode". Slack is great when you're in collaboration
    mode, but it's ok to turn off all channels and focus on your work
    too.
  - It's always better to speak up if you have a concern, or any
    information that might be important to the group. If you're worried
    about how the group will react, say so. We're all commited to
    speaking up, and listening respectfully. We can't make the right
    decision without everyone sharing all their information. Find a way
    to share your concern, that you are most comfortable with.
  - Talk to your team and clients every single day you work. You should
    indicate what you're working on, and keep track of any special
    deadlines set by your team. For example, when you're blocking
    someone else or a client requests a special deadline.

### Calendar Expectations

  - The calendar is the single source of truth for meetings. They are
    only held by people invited to actual calendar events.
  - We do reply to calendar invitations (within 24h, because that's the
    maximum frequency for checking email)
  - We make our calendars public (to show when we're busy, not exact
    events).
  - We add our vacations or holidays into the event calendar as
    following: “Name” vacation (\# of days )

### Email Hygiene

Email is good for company-wide announcements that require a follow-up.
Indicate when you want a response by. Email is good for communicating
with stakeholders that aren't active in other channels (prospects,
external project stakeholders).

  - We recommend you disable email notifications on your phone. It's a
    non-urgent channel and we don't want to be distracted by it.
  - Email good for announcements, but should link to something in Trello
    (if it requires followup), Google Docs (if it is a resource we may
    need later), or Slack (if it's a discussion).
  - The email channel is not urgent: 24h response time is ok. We
    recommend checking email only twice daily, only on weekdays during
    business hours. If the email is from a colleague, customer, or
    prospect, you must follow up within 24h of an email being sent if
    they expect a response. If a task is requested, either complete the
    task or reply indicating what steps you've taken, what's still
    needed, and when it will be completed with a link to a Trello card.
  - Respond to emails in a way that minimizes back-and-forth. Use a
    calendly link to book meetings if it's with just one other person.
  - No need to check emails during vacation (unless otherwise agreed
    upon). =\> see next line
  - **You must have an autoresponder set when on vacation**: including
    return date from vacation / back-up contact and details / back-up
    person gets a briefing.
  - Use the "schedule send" option in gmail if sending after hours or on
    the weekend. it's a dropdown on the send button. This helps train
    team members and clients to take a break outside work hours.

### Text

  - If you'd like someone's attention because you're blocked and they're
    not responding on Slack, we recommend you text them. Do this only
    when necessary.
  - This means, we should share our phone numbers, but only use them for
    urgent requests.

### Guidelines for Communicating Face-to-Face

(In video and in-person meetings)

  - Make eye contact 50% of the time when speaking, and 100% of the time
    when listening.
  - Never speak for more than 1 minute without pausing for the other
    person to speak. If they don't, then you can continue.
  - Get in the habit of repeating things back to people concisely in
    your own words. It proves you actually heard them and gave it some
    thought.
  - Everyone in a group should speak some of the time, with
    contributions as equal as possible.
  - It's helpful to be aware of different communication styles when interacting with others, especially in video meetings where there may be audio latency. This [Stack Overflow Blog article](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/02/11/why-are-video-calls-so-tiring-you-might-be-misreading-cultural-styles/) is a useful read.

### Phone

  - For truly urgent or critical things, we call each other (cell
    phone). Only do this in the evening or weekend of the recipient's
    timezone if it's an emergency. This should be RARE.

### Trello

  - Trello is for tracking what we need to get done (actionable tasks and
reminders). We use variants of Scrum, details [here](../TRELLO/).

### Office Hours and Presence

  - Overall objective: achieving our goals but also balancing work &
    private life in a meaningful way
  - However, also take team spirit, team efficiency and feeling of
    togetherness into account.
  - Make sure your calendar is up-to-date and shared/public so we know
    how to reach someone if urgent

## Meetings

See [Meetings](../../peopleops/MEETINGS/)

## Slack Hygiene

Slack is for asynchronous, non-critical, informal coordination and
updates.

Use the following notification setting. You should only be notified when
people direct message or mention you, and only during your work hours.
![Slack Notification Setting](recommended-slack-setting.png)

  - Go straight to the point. Don't send people messages to check if
    someone's online, like "Clark", "hey, you there?", or "Can I ask you
    a question?". This sucks, because the person now has to stare at the
    screen for 2 minutes while you write them a message. Just get to the
    point and don't worry about when, they'll reply when they can. The
    expected response time on slack is up to 4 hours during the
    recipient's work hours, so they should check it twice a day. When
    people are in "focus mode", they shouldn't have slack open as it's a
    distraction.

  - Slack is ok for reminders about tasks, but isn't meant for assigning
    something critical, especially to the whole company. Use Trello +
    email for that.

  - If the message could be useful to more than one person, post it in
    the most relevant public or project channel.

  - No instant reply required. Our communication priority order is: 1)
    Call/Text 2) Slack 3) Email 4) Trello 5) Reddit

  - Try to interact with the team about twice per work day on slack, but
    don't leave it open all day, you need some quiet time to focus on
    work. Catch up on your channels, skim and respond where needed.

  - if you read something on a public slack channel, understand it, and
    find it useful, please give a thumbs up or whatever emoticon. It
    helps the people who post in public channels the most to know who's
    read things and what to post.

  - For group action items, use email instead, and set a deadline.

  - The perfect example of what to use Slack for is:
    
    1)  When you're blocked by something, make noise to the team
        channel.
    
    (2) Create clarity around objectives and user stories. State your
    understanding in your own words, so teammates can confirm we're on
    the same page.

## Giving Feedback to Teammates

Our team must provide each other with feedback regularly in order to
improve. Some references on why this is:

  - When a thoughtful dissenting opinion is introduced to a discussion,
    it quadruples the chance of the group finding the best answer (study
    cited in Originals, book)
  - Feedback from peers is the most effective way to grow
    professionally. (Originals)
  - Honest feedback prevents the perils of "group think" that damages
    teams as they grow. (Culture code)
  - [Gratitude makes you happier](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier)

### When To Give Feedback

  - Code reviews (following norms [here](../../programming/GIT/) The benefits
    of Senior developers reviewing Junior developers' code is obvious I
    hope, but it's just as critical to provide feedback as a Jr
    dev because:
    (1) you can learn much faster by reading others' code, and asking
    questions.
    (2) your questions will help Sr devs make their work more
    understandable.
    (3) it motivates Sr devs to have someone learning from them and
    seeing their work in general.
    4)  you can help other Jr devs learn.
    (5) It forces you to understand our standards and apply them better
    if you have to measure other people's work against them
    6)  Sr devs still make of mistakes
  - Peer reviews of UX and Art assets. Ask our team members to share XD
    links, screenshots your work on slack, and give them feedback in
    comments in XD, or right on Slack.
  - When there's a new release, review the stage site for your product.
  - Post a video of using a new product or UI, for the creator to see in
    that project channel.
  - Just PM (Private Message) someone on slack with your thoughts. Ask
    questions, state exact observations, and say how you feel about
    them. (See below, Guidelines)
  - Use the \#thanks channel to show appreciation and gratitude. A ton
    of
    [evidence](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier)
    suggests this makes you, the recipient, and the whole team happier.

### Guidelines Around Feedback

  - Ask your team for feedback. Make it easy for them by sharing a link,
    getting a code review, making a little demo video of what you did,
    or just asking a specific question "What could I improve in my
    fireball casting technique?".
  - When someone does something you like, let them know\! That's how we
    get them to do it more. Positive feedback is *easy* to give,
    everyone feels good\!
  - Remember the purpose of feedback. We have a team so we can help each
    other improve.
  - Keep it simple and clear. Mention the most important facts
    (observations) to avoid overwhelming the recipient. Small bits of
    frequent feedback are better than a huge essay.
  - It's not about who's right. The process of talking about performance
    and how do things improves everyone's work and helps us work
    together constructively. So don't stress. If you can give and
    receive feedback respectfully we've already won at this no matter
    what that leads to.

### Negative Feedback

Giving negative feedback can be hard, as we don't want to offend. The
problem is often that people just say "I don't like when you cast green
fireballs." with no explanation. Instead: "When you cast green fireballs
I'm concerned that it makes too much smoke. I've seen this reddit post
about it."

  - Make it clear the goal is to improve the work, and you're giving
    feedback because our team has high expectations, but you think the
    other person can meet them.
  - Be very respectful, constructive, helpful, humble and never mean or
    demeaning.
  - it's ok to be blunt. If you do have evidence of what the problem is,
    be very specific. It's not about your opinion, it's about the facts,
    you're just pointing out evidence.
  - It's also ok to be subtle. Especially if you're not sure what the
    problem is, try being subtle first. Pause to show you're thinking
    and then ask "Does that really work?" "I never thought of doing it
    that way, do you prefer it to my way?". When you question something
    out of genuine curiousity, the person will stop and do the same,
    without being offended. They may not change the behaviour right away
    but it helps more than you think.
  - It often helps to be clear about the actual problem. "I'm concerned
    that if we cast green fireballs, it causes too much pollution." This
    invites them to dismiss you of course, but it will stick in their
    mind.
  - Sometimes it helps to suggest an alternative but stick to the facts.
    "I use blue fireballs because it seems like it saves the
    environment, have you tried it?"

### Receiving Feedback

  - It's hard for others to give you feedback, and it's precious. You don't have to agree, you just have to listen.
  - Don't interrupt, dismiss, or show impatience or offence. Show
    appreciation for them putting themselves out there to help you
    improve.
  - Paraphrase in your own words. "It sounds like you're saying blue
    fireballs produce less harmful carbon, but defeat just as many
    goblins."
