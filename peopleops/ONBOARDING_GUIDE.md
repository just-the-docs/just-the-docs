**Purpose**

The goal of this guide is to help new members of Countable get connected
with the team, efficiently set up accounts, and learn key things to help
you get started contributing\! If you find a way to improve this
document, send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/countable-web/ops-manual/pull/new/master)\!
If anything is unclear, let's fix it so it's clear for the next person.

**Scope**

Covers all the onboarding steps for a new Countable Team Member.

## First Steps

  - Get a countable.ca email address (ask your manager to create it),
    and [set up your signature](https://youtu.be/hA5cRIDg0Ko)
  - Use your email address to [sign up on our slack](https://join.slack.com/t/countable-web/signup).
  - Use our slack to say hi to the team. Share your:
      - New Title
      - Last Company
      - Hometown
      - School
      - Hobbies
      - Two True things about you, and a Lie (let the team guess which).
  - Use the team to answer your other questions.
  - Add your work availability to your calendar [using Google's Work Hours](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en). These should account for at least half of your planned working time, but don't have to be 40+ hours- leave yourself some time for deep and uninterrupted work!

### Set your profile photo

  - As a remote team, it makes it easier for our team and clients to
    track who everyone is if you upload a profile photo. Upload your
    photo to all accounts, especially Slack, Email, BitBucket, GitHub.

### Set up Eightmeters

[See here](https://countable-ops-manual.readthedocs.io/peopleops/DOING_YOUR_JOB#using-eightmeters)

### Team Calendar

  - Go to calendar.google.com from your Countable Google Apps account.
  - You should see our team calendar with meetings to attend.
  - When you are travelling, create an event indicating your time away
    and whether you're working 50% or 0%.

### Payment Info

  - Provide a void cheque (in Canada this includes your bank account
    number, routing/transit number and institution number) to our
    accounting staff.

### Environment

  - Set up a [physical space and equipment](https://countable-ops-manual.readthedocs.io/peopleops/DOING_YOUR_JOB#setting-up-your-desk)
    to work.
  - devs only - Read about our [DevOps](./devops/DEVOPS) and
    [Coding Standards](./programming/CODING_STANDARDS)
  - devs only - Complete the [Training](./programming/TRAINING) following these practices and get a team member to code review it using a feature
    branch and pull request.
  - Order a book that will help you learn your job, and bill the company
    for it.

Fill [this onboarding form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYLUdoD5z1OhMNbhXC4G3GDLVbumoPH9X-mnNPDRaR2YQiwA/viewform?usp=sf_link).
It contains information we need for you to start work at Countable.

Join these using your Google account:

  - (devs only) [Sentry](http://sentry.countable.ca). Join the `Sentry`
    team.
  - (devs only) [Jenkins](http://jenkins.countable.ca). Ask your manager
    to be added to projects.

### How to Do Work

Skim this so you know the language and how we work: [Project Management](./operations/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT).

### Confirm

You should now go on the slack \#general channel and announce that
you've completed onboarding, or we'll assume you haven't and complain.

### Before You Start Working

  - Skim this entire manual and take notes so you know what's in here.
  - If something *specific to our company* isn't in here, ask team mates
    for help liberally and ensure it gets documented concisely in the
    right place.
  - Review the [staff homepage](https://sites.google.com/countable.ca/countable-staff/home),
    for commonly used resources including the Google Drive stuff you can
    access. Sign in as countable email to view this page.
  - It's a great idea to bookmark [the eightmeters URL](https://eightmeters.countable.ca) and OKRs URL (Google Sheet)
    in your bookmarks bar. Because you should access both of these
    things frequently.

### When You Start Working

You'll be learning a lot, and we don't expect you to necessarily
complete tasks every day when you work. But, you are expected to:

  - Let your team know what you did and what you struggled with, on
    Slack every day, because we need to know that in order to help you
    learn. It doesn't help anyone if you're stuck, and we want to help.
  - Commit your code and push it to `develop` or a new branch with a
    Pull Request every day.
  - Try your best to complete a tiny task, rather than partially
    finishing a big task.
  - Expectations that are required to be part of Countable (level 1) and
    for promotion are documented here: [Evaluation](./programming/EVALUATION).

### How To Ask For Help

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY14Er6JX2s), skip to
11 minute mark and watch steps for asking for help. Summary.

  - If you struggle more than 15 mins, ask for help. (if you're waiting
    for a response, move to something else meanwhile.)
  - Demonstrate competence - Be clear.
  - Indicate what % done you are on the project. "I'm 30% done this, and
    stuck on X. I already tried A and B."
  - Show what you've already tried.
  - After you get a response, say it back to the mentor to demonstrate
    your understanding.
  - Document what you learned. If it will apply to others, put it in a
    public space such as this manual.

### What's Next?

The team should spend lots of time with new staff, and over-communicate.
