# Subcontractor Work Agreement

**Purpose**

Transparently share our work agreement.

**Scope**

TODO: This document is out of date and the official one has not been
converted to markdown and open-sourced.

This is the agreement template we hold with everyone who works at the
firm.

## Term

  - This agreement may be terminated by either party at any time.
    However, it's courtesy to give 2 weeks of notice if the contract has
    held for at least 3 months consecutively.
  - Nature of relationship - Because it's a contract position, you are
    not an employee but instead a business associate, no payroll
    deductions are made. You are responsible for remitting income taxes
    and other deductions to the appropriate governing bodies.

## Compensation and Expenses

  - Compensation - You will be paid an hourly rate for hours worked and
    recorded, with payment for each calendar month sent to you within
    one week of the following calendar month. The expectation is you
    will work a predefined number of hours per week starting when this
    agreement commences or a specified start date.
  - Leave - There is no paid vacation time. However, unpaid leave may be
    taken as long as communicated 2 weeks in advance.
  - Benefits - The typical employment benefits do not apply between the
    subcontractor and firm. The rate negoatiated should be increased
    accordingly to account for this. Please note that if you purchase
    any of these services yourself (such as extended medical benefits),
    they may be deducted from your taxable income.
  - Claimed Expenses - Business expenses (travel, conferences) approved
    in advance by a Partner are paid along with your regular
    compensation.
  - Unclaimed Expenses - Business expenses not claimed (Food and drink,
    home office, computers) may be deducted on your tax return.
  - Equipment and Office - You will provide your own equipment and
    office space. A Linux laptop or workstation is recommended; Mac OS
    also works; Windows, less so.

## Other

  - Confidentiality - You agree to hold in confidence and not to
    disclose to an outside party, any data you were given access to by
    Countable or parties who hold a business relationship with
    Countable, unless given explicit permission by the owner of said
    data, and for a period of 5 years after the termination of this
    agreement. In the event of a more strict confidentiality contract is
    held between Countable and the Client on a specific project, you
    will be required to agree to additional terms before engaging with
    that Client.
  - Non-compete and non-solicitation - You agree not to enter into an
    employment or paid contract relationship with Countable's Clients or
    other of Countable's subcontractors or employees, for a period of 6
    months of the termination of this agreement.

## Discussion

The fact you're not an employee is a bit strange but it has a lot of
advantages. In a way it's more like joining an exclusive "guild" than
being an employee. As questions arise I'll post explanations here so
this page improves over time.
