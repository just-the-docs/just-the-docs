# Applicant Guide

DRAFT
{: .label .label-green }

**Purpose**

Help people judge if they are a good fit, and apply to join our team.

**Scope**

Indicate who we are, what it's like to work here, and what we've learned
about who we expect to be a good fit.

## Welcome\!

  - This is a guide for people applying to Countable. We'll expand it in
    the future (with your feedback I hope). For now, we suggest:
    
      - Read about who we think is a good [Hiring Fit](HIRING_FIT.md)
      - Check out countable.ca (and cortico.ca) to see a bit about our
        work.

  - Email us with the following:
    
      - Links to your work online (anything you've created).
      - We want to hear your story, and what's different about you.
      - Why are you applying to Countable?
      - We love feedback! Tell us how we can make your experience
        applying to Countable better!
      - To avoid bots and automated submissions, and to see if you read
        this sentence, please make your email with the above exactly 100
        words (it will be hard to fit).
