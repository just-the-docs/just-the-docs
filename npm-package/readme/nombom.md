This is a quick, ridiculous CLI tool to `nombom`.

```
rm -rf node_modules
npm cache clean
npm install

rm -rf bower_components
bower cache clean
bower install
```

Because, sometimes you just need to nom.

## Installation

```
npm install -g nombom
```

## Usage

Within your project execute the following in your terminal:

```
nombom
```

You can also execute `nom` or `bom` separately, and pass in the `--log` if you
want to see the output of the command.
