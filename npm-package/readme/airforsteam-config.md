#### Why?
I got tired of applying my desired theme options after each update of the skin.

Also, copying files on mac is awful.

## Download
[View Releases](https://github.com/nysos3/airforsteam-config/releases/latest)

#### Windows
Download and run airforsteam.Setup.X.X.X.exe

>Please be aware that Windows SmartScreen will pop-up saying that the software is from an unidentified developer. This behavior is expected, as I cannot afford a $1200+ certificate for signing the apps.

#### macOS
Download airforsteam-X.X.X.dmg or airforsteam-X.X.X-mac.zip

#### Linux
Download airforsteam_X.X.X_amd64.snap
